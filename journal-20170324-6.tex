The difference between the obvious and the apparent lies within the
capacity to identify, characterize, to weigh, to sense the existence
of avenues of exploration and development leading out from a vertex of
art or science.

That history writes of the subjugation of the individual is obvious,
or at least well known.  That the lessons of history make apparent the
inutility or disservice of the exploitation of the individual should
be obvious and well known.
