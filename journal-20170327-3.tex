\input preamble

ï»¿The boy at the bar was probably aged nearly thirty, but his body spoke
puppy language.  One particular female seemed to tow his attention.
She passed by in a frock, I jest, that could be made to inject an
expectation with the reflection of it.

She returned, innocuously enough, to do just that.  And not without
paying the bills on that rent.  A leg twitched in that manner that
could almost put me off my grandmother's roast beef.  Either one, both
were equally unique and worthwhile.
