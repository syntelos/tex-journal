\input preamble

Camping in Foggy Bottom with the stars over head has stretched my
brain over a horizon that leaves the consciousness thinned by that
particular state of hunger I've subscribed to.  What was that knife?
What was that line?  What was that date?  What was hypothesis number
123?  No idea.  Stuff.  No matter.  Only one thing matters.  A little
thing bigger than any other thing.  And so it goes.  What should.
What could.  What would.  Any doubts?  Any regrets?  Any thoughts?
Doubts?  Sometimes a pang of a doubt that lasts only so long as to
test the doubt.  Regrets?  None.  Thoughts?  None you don't know by
now, and far fewer than that in truth.  And hearth?  It is the same.
It has only a little candle burning where there should be logs boiling
soup and baking bread.  So we go, as you like, because if there's one
thing I know about myself it's that I really can't see myself getting
divorced again.  Besides, better to have a marriage before a divorce
if possible.  Campy?  Pretty much.  Camping in the cold with Christmas
around the corner is depressing.

Glenn is a poet who gives me food and shakes his head at me with
regard.  Jordan watches his tablet video while Glenn smokes outside.
Rosetta's kitchen.  Second floor.  The sound system is pretty good.
Something that could have moved Travolta and Thurman around a diner.
Something warm.  Something good.
