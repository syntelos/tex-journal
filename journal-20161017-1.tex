\input preamble

The mind forgets some pretty important stuff.

It's disappointing, this frailty.

The memory and its stories.

The body and the mind.

At the center of this existence, the {\it accelerations} of facility
that act upon {\it masses} of awareness and concern to produce the
{\it forces} that do {\it work} within.

As producing memory for consciousness.

As producing story for interaction.

As is the frailty of destiny.

The balance of the inner consciousness and outer consciousness
available through Meditation and Hara and Art and Math and Science and
Work and Interaction meet the {\it Arc of History} at the {\it
Individual} to the cost and benefit of {\it Future Generations}.
