\input preamble

Does this make any sense?  

No.  It makes sense as the application of this medium to learning.  It
makes sense as an educational experience.  Learning about each other.
Learning to communicate.  

You said this is about this.  Otherwise it would look entirely
different.  So from this thin line we derive our language.  We make
love.  Romantic love.  Much more than a social intercourse.  A
romantic one.  And in this we've persevered for more than a year.
We've arrived at this point by a long walk.  It is a marriage that
depends on the confirmation or denial of this truth, which we'll
arrive at by meeting.

We've had another paradigm shift.  We've walked over ground.  Now we
walk under-ground.  It's so deep that another, more conventional
relationship could live on top of it without notice.  At least that's
me.  And I think you said that this is shared.  Perhaps not my
vulgarity, my insanity, but our depths.
