As a song becomes a prayer, I have thee.  As a bed becomes a church, I
have thee.  As your air captures and possesses, as I have thee.  As I
wander and live and learn, I have thee.  As I exist, you exist.  As I
breathe, you breathe.  As I have walked, you have walked.  And as I
have lived, you have lived.

I cannot write that I am free, but it is none but yours.  Ours, in
truth.  It is me and you and here and there.

I don’t mind your states of mind.  I don’t mind your legs bold and
weak.  I don’t mind your changes of color.  Because I understand the
line you walk.  It is mine.
