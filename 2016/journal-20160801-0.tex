\input preamble

I suppose it happens once every two years.  I see a girl I'd like to
make babies with.  When I was young I tried to do a bit of something
about it when there was an opportunity.  Then I learned that that's
not what I'm really looking for.  It's too important.  It needs a
profound love.  The first ingredient for healthy babies.  It's really
hard, knowing this, because it's forgotten in the little minutes of
here and there.  It becomes no more than a compliment, a look that
says ``I could make babies with you''.  By now it's written into the
calm that the forgotten minutes possess.  That the big deal is so much
more than making babies.  It's love.  The binding of the parents, in
this context, that's most important to me.  But I'm male.  The male
follows a different biological path than the female.  And while I'm
fully capable of a conventional relationship, it's not what I'm
looking for.  So it's hard to catch me on that kind of hook.  Hasn't
been done, anyway.  And now, it's plainly impossible to catch me at
all.  Because she exists, the one I've been looking for.  I found her.
What are the odds?  Pretty long.
