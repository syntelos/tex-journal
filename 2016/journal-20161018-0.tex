\input preamble

ER signs the art of change in KP.  Her BREXIT shoulders the Law.
Perhaps a Queen.  What will we do without a Queen, England.

You will have your Queen, John.  And I will rest the Law on our backs.
As it should be.  Our special place is secure.  Our freedom from
History in our relation to it.  History and Government.  I cannot
write that is ideal, but it is at least a worthwhile ball of air.
