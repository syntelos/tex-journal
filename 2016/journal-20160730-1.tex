\input preamble

I won't write the book, here.  But the last sentence reads, ``because
she exists''.  For me the baby question is best written ``whatever
she's got''.

Oh, it's so messy.  That she should drop into that song -- a movie
queen into a wishing well.  In a castle dark.  With chains upon my
feet.  It is her.  She exists.
