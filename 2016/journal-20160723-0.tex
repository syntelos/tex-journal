\input preamble

Intellectual independence frees ones decisions and choices from
parental and social mores.  It is important to one's emotional health
that the emotional waves of experience are not strained before one has
gained the benefit of experience.  

That we cling to each other emotionally and then stress each other
emotionally in the performance of dysfunctional relationships is no
mystery.  That this is a form of emotional and intellectual immaturity
is not well known.  At least it is not well employed as a fact and
model of the human experience.
