\input preamble

The cultural psychology of self deficit, that social force that holds
us back from flying?  The socio-cultural languages of personal
interaction?  Those things?  People who have a problem with
individuals who fly will duck.  One of the miracles that's no more
than a portal -- a conscious understanding -- we all walk through
together.
