\input preamble

That I should not have accepted kindness a falsehood.  It was
momentary -- and ended badly, but it was kindness and support and
love.  It said, at the very least, ``Thank you for your service''.

That we should reject fear and violence and hate as unworthy -- not
worthwhile, laid at the feet of the hypocracy of the self righteous
that would speak it.
