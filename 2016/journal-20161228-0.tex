\input preamble

Addicted to pushing myself and living through giving and learning.
It's neither practical nor necessary.  Driving myself nuts.  Enough of
that.  I could work.  Oh, I could work.  I could stand up and walk
away.  But then what.  Where would I be.  Fed.  Sane.  Does that
count?  I'd rather meet Sophie on Broadway.  I'd rather she sat down
here in front of me before I finished this sentence.
