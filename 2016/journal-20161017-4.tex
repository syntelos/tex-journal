\input preamble

The human social network is capable of subliminal synchrony across
groups large and small.  Could be called {\it hive mind} for the
beauty of the phenomenon.

Once love locked into a secure trust network, the group will cooperate
without question or concern for time or effort.  The group coordinates
most effortlessly through simple and complex interaction.  

Signaling, messaging, and conversation coordinate within association
contexts explicit and implicit.  An explicit context could be on the
table, or on the television.  An implicit context could be in the back
yard, or on another social association tree.
