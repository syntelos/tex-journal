\input preamble

Olivia asks, and the star family puts great heaping sums upon, ``what
is the point of the Electoral College?''.  Extra points for
implications.


This structure emphasizes the high bar placed upon the ambiguity of
Article Two (the Executive).  Good, or bad.

The implication is the depth of thought invested in the Constitution,
not unlike something written by the bard at his best.  Which, in turn,
points a finger at the hole in the ways and means of the electoral
contest: that it remains an open problem to be solved as circumscribed
by the papers of the Constitutional Convention.

Furthermore, this structure emphasizes the honor and responsibility of
political office, generally.  Those elected to represent others wear a
mantle of gravity that requires the individual to transcend one's
personal interests and to find the common good that best serves
everyone over the longest term that can be reached.

With the recent affair in Constitutional issues we have enough data to
satisfy any inquiry into the subject.  We've been living with ``soft''
solutions for the duration.  Presently we're in the process of
producing a ``hard'' solution in the form of a Constitutional
Amendment.  While the poetry of reflection found in the form of the
Constitution is breathtaking at these heights, we need to reach for
the long term and install a solution.
