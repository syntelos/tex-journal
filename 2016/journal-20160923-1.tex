\input preamble

I played with goats today.

Had to round em up, and catch em behind a fence.

You might imagine some of our interactions, as they accepted me into
their order.  The oldest young male spoke of our relationship, as is
the way I've observed their society.

We agreed that it would be difficult to say more than I love you.
