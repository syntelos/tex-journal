\input preamble

The ledge fell off into darkness, over it no more than two or three
inches of lake, and then a spit of sand and grass that lead up the
hill to the lodge house where we took our meals.  A dining room, a
kitchen, a porch, and a corridor were each well travelled places.
Away from the lake, on the top of the hill, the kitchen.  And across
the dirt road a garden.  Beyond that, a cow pasture that expanded into
miles.

The spit wrapped the lake in a cove on either side.  This side and the
other.  Between them some grass and sand, a couple trees, and hidden
away a pile of heavy woody brush where the black snakes lived.

One summer I was king of the black snakes.  The next they were the
king of me.  The experience of evolution of consciousness quite
distinct.  In each year, as in each decade, the complexity of the mind
expands.
