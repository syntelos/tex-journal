\input preamble

An image stirs me so.  I think of men fighting and self loathing of
their sex.  In this image, I would cure it if I could, in an act of
wide open love.  But not.  It is a fantasy.  An inflammation of the
kind.  In this world it is not a cure, it is an inflammatory to the
collective consciousness.
