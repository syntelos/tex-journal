\input preamble

It is the breath of life that we write in Art.  It is the love of
ancestry and the freedom of originality.  The determinism of blood and
the will of intellect.  That to fear these things is to fear life.
The poverty of ideology and the wealth of principle.  The foundation
on sand versus rock.  Expressing love no less essential than
breathing, especially when passing through its gateways would promise
an incandescent arrest of the heart.  For such is the will to life as
the need to love, that boundaries within will fall down before life
and love as boundaries without might resist our Art.
