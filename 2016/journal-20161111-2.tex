\input preamble

If it is by work that we learn, it is also by experience that we
learn.  By experience one can hone a skill into reflexes, whether or
not it has a relation to work.  By practice we learn to read and to
speak and to write.  By generosity we learn of consciousness.  By
reading each other we learn of subjectivity and subliminality.
