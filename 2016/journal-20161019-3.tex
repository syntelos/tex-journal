\input preamble

The intellect is a part of the body.  The male hunter and female
gatherer that inhabit us know the body first.  That is, the inner
consciousness that resides within knows the body and intellect as one.

The space within is spiritual.  It is reached by a focus from within
under the meditative exercises that come with great effort.  

The exterior (mind) is exercised with intellectual efforts.  The
interior (soul) is exercised through the balancing of spirit and will
that comes with great effort.
