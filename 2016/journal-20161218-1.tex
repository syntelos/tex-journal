\input preamble

It's always there.  Memory and awareness.  As a castaway I'm under my
memories.  Reflection of death and loss.  As a contributor I'm above
my memories.  Reflections of {\it plein air} and freedom.  

This over and under the high and low of interior life.  Where I've
been and where I'm going.
