\input preamble

Standing in the boat pond the water comes up to the knee, or almost.
The water is edged with a ring of finely carved limestone.  The boat
house on its eastern shore filled to its rafters with radio controlled
craft that number enough to permit the imagination to wonder if every
variety is not represented.  Down the street from there, a couple long
avenue blocks, a castle.  A mansion.  The remains of an old house also
pieced together from well cut blocks of limestone, but more gothic
than republican.

I entered the house through the front door, its lock forgotten long
ago, its hinges would hold it shut.  The wooden floors passable,
before me a stair that lead up, into the dark.  To the left a chamber
and fireplace, to the right some bit of its maze.

The stair up to the second floor ended there.  To get to the third
floor I would have to unwind another bit of its secrets: a winding
staircase in a remote corner.  On the third floor an oval gallery, a
music room according to the plaster over head.
