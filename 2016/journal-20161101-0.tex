\input preamble

The poverty of dusk descends around me.  The tearful hour long passed.
The funnies of the air yield to the vagaries of public life.

The awareness of the matter of public life has developed within, and a
perception and prescription around it.  The past three years come into
their usual focus again.

Fact.  Opinion.  Violence.

I don't imagine it could have happened any other way.  To do so would
be to take it all on again.    

I have my life, and that's as comprehensive as it's going to get.


\bye
