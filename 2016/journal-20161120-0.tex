\input preamble

My mother's ideological nightmare wakes me to the image of angels
singing over this cold grave.  That he should pick himself up, dust
himself off, and and start all over again.  

It is a false conception with some bearing in my experience of this
moment.  It is the {\it ideogogy} produced by ideology.  

It is the holding too close of ideas too small.  And it would kill me.

What magnitude and rotation has this wave-form with respect to my own?
It is an orthogonal placed in a certain percusive form of art that
brings me no pleasure.  It is dark and cold like this place this
morning.

You know of which I speak.  This art and the history of art, this
science and the history of science.  It has a depth of experience that
demands representation.  The host of love and the humanity of fate.
