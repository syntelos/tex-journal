\input preamble

A commercial on the sound stream just accused Claire of over sharing
and causing Jeremy frustration.  This is a nice example of the ego
candy, feeding the lust that injures rather than the sense that
protects.

The ego is a funny thing.  As a single observer with my own unique
experience, the ego is a virtual object of the psyche.  Unlike virtual
particles in Physics, the virtual ego represents the facility of the
psyche to preserve oneself through action and effort.  It has no need
to exist, and ceases to exist when it is not needed.

The socio-cultural terms of situation signal the human future
environmental risks.  We teach ourselves to signal and to fight.
There's no mystery.  It is us.  We are it.  And it is {\it homo
sapien}.
