\input preamble

What's wrong with the males?  There is a lack of {\it mentis compos}
or power to overcome the primitives they're playing with.  Ego.  Sex.
Media.  Voice.  Socio-cultural terms of situation.  They sink like
rocks at the unexpected.  Go to red mode.  Paranoia.  Delusion.
Domination and subjugation.

I call it {\it ego obesity}.  In the experience there has been too
little education and other opposition to the ego.  A nice example is
the football coach who changes the rules of the game to suit the
majority rather than the principle he espoused five minutes earlier.
This kind of ego candy feeds the primitive of lust over sense.

It is an enormous poverty of self, an ability to read without
guardedness or interpretation.  

On the bright side, we're all in this soup together, and the ability
to speak without guardedness is one of the pinnacles of my own
writing.  It's not a flattering look.  I justify it and rationalize it
and watch it and care for it.  Not quite stepping over the threshold
with freedom.  Cautiously approaching each millisecond and pausing it
for days, weeks, months, years, and lives.
