\input preamble

O.K. Fanny Farmer, Frame Farmer, John Pritchard, Dudley Newton, or
whatever your name is.  You gonna tell em about that frame thing you
spent god knows how many years sorting out?

Whew, maybe in a couple when I get a bit more brain matter going on.
That one's a wicked ride through what I got at the moment.  Would need
to blow up my framing hammer into a jet engine.
