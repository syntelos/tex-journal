\input preamble

Children see the right and wrong in the relationships and issues they
can see.  Sometimes better than adults.  Sometimes with power and
import proportional to the situation.

As we've been leading into, the clothes that adults wear can change
faster and deeper than children are aware of.  The adults know these
places.  Sometimes they have to remember.  That can take a lot of
time.  Minutes or hours or days or weeks or years or decacdes.  

Just like growing up, but remembering the days of the journey.
