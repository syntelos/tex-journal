\input preamble

Blind while I can see.  Not knowing.  That simplest of problems so
intolerable in this case.  In the case of love.  Call it love.
Romantic love.  The human reproductive binding that is made for a
lifetime in some cases.

I may pick up some stoory about a sailboat, a couple, some solar
power, a lot of fish, and plenty of convenient weather.  Gerard and
Sophie take the plunge.  Do they have kids?  Hm.  Makes a mess of that
plot line, so no.  Oh, my.  A breath of fresh air.
