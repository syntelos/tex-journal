\input preamble

\indent

{\it As a poem becomes a prayer, I love thee.}

{\it As a soul becomes divine, I love thee.}

\noindent

As my heart would crush itself to protect you, I love thee.

Last night we became lovers since we were two.

I can't remember what the words are that represent that, but I know it
to be true.
