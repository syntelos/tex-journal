\input preamble

No one should be that strong.  Someone must be that strong, or we all
die slaves to this machine, this madness, this poverty as he puts it.

He clears his head from the frame of passion in which an almond shaped
tumor of reflection delivers that habitual tune.  He thinks of the
silence as he lies in bed resting.  The stream of production from the
sense to output that delivers the pleasure of acknowledgement or
contribution or recognition that satisfies the causal loop of merit
and accomplishment.

How many times did I free them from themselves and still they deny me
a place of any proportion, save the slightest grace that costs very
nearly nothing.  That I might feel it and they might escape it.
