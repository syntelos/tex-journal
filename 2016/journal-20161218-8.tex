\input preamble

Anthropology holds a special place among the sciences for the
discipline required to do it well.  To apply the discipline of science
to the study of people requires a profound respect and admiration for
humanity.  Personally the anthropologist must love people, and
professionally the anthropologist must preserve a profound sense of
respect while dissecting lives.

Social anthropology is easier.  The study of society and culture is
more abstract than lives.  Simple excellence may suffice to preserve
the responsibilities undertaken by the individual who endeavors to
perform the r\^ole of social scientist.
