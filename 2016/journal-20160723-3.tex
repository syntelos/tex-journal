\input preamble

The eyes wince and the brain reels at the realization of it.  That
this could constitute a relationship, a marriage, has a kind of
violence to it.  The situation requires a degree of safety, a
grounding, an orthogonal to the understanding that preserves the
psychological interior.  That is, that it must become healthy to the
person and his body -- either by its condensation, realization,
actualization, or by independence.
