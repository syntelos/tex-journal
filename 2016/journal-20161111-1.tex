\input preamble

As the energy of the morning entered into her body, Ruby laid her head
on her mother's breast and fell into the heartbeat that was her life.

Jen fell into the heartbeat that was her future, her eye held a point
in space between her couple and the wall.

Her body had given life in the current of energy that rose and fell
with waves of exhaustion that beat the emotions out of the brush fires
around her.
