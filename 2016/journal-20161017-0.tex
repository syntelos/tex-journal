\input preamble

The use of our metaphysical tools is not unlike the use of our
intellectual tools.  Through work we have learned the difference
between the spiritual interior and exterior.  

The exterior is not unlike a computer or astronaut's helmet.  The
intellectual mind can be put aside while the spiritual mind of the
interior consciousness lives life.  

In this mode of being, the body learns to employ the intellect -- an
important counter-balance to the typical aspect of being.

The intellect cannot employ the spirit in the same way.  The spirit
always, in fact, employs the mind.
