\input preamble

The difficulty in learning Physics is in getting out of the subjective
bed: realizing how true it is, and by extension how simple objectivity
is.  

By analogy, the subtext in the news from the United States projection
of force is not nuclear.  This is weighed in school.  In the news,
between the lines, it is intellectual.  It is strategic and
occasionally tectical.

Avoiding examples and dilemmas, in the abstract we can see a
discipline of bearing.  The concept of tools and toys applies as
disciplines and examples, or instances and cases and actuality -- that
is, abstract and actual.

In the abstract is policy and law.  Government and its branches.  In
actuality are votes and committees and cases and studies, reports and
reviews.  Checks and balances adapted to situation.

Adapt and overcome.

Semper fidelis.
