\input preamble

The issues identified by the male human with the female role of life
run through us with the same river of current and force.  

While some would make dirt and trash over it.  I wonder how many think
that it's just sex.  It's hard to imagine, but clearly it exists.
It's no betrayal to say so.  Many push on sex with a relentless
abandon at points.

Some say this, and others say that.  It is not for you to know, except
as might a jacket wear.  For the signs of life are but symbols spoke.
Breath offered.  And bonds broke.

Hear my song that I might breathe again.  I hear your song.  I am
present.  I am aware.  And I am engaged.
