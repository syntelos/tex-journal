\input preamble

The responsibilities of human existence include an obligation to do
what you can for others, subject to one's obligations to oneself.

The responsibilities of money and leisure include an obligation to
consider the disposition of wealth with respect to society, and its
impact on future generations.

Giving partially may be more healthy than giving endlessly, but that's
really far out there on a moment when everyone gives partially so no
one needs to give endlessly.

One chooses.  That is, one meets life on one's own path.  If that's
your true path, then you have nothing to apologize to anyone else for.

No one has a right to judge others.  

Interesting the implication in the socio-moral cosmology.  We know
that {\it crime} is wrong.  Did we notice that {\it courts} could have
alternative interpretations and representations?  Sounds like
something Foucault and Genet would have covered.
