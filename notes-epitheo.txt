The strict or militant follower of doctrine typically desires to
establish boundaries for itself or its children, while the effect can
be destructive rather than constructive.  

The child may feel violated by the imposition of thought belief that
violates the boundaries of learning necessary to understanding and
peace in the context of experience.

The young adult may become lost within experience such that
alternative experience is pursued in the relatively biological need
for security or the psychological elimination of vulnerability or
search for peace.

Boundaries are not entirely wrong.  Children often respond positively
to structure as experience is occasionally overwhelming.  The
relationship between the inner and outer consciousness is temporal --
the inner consciousness develops the emotional terms of character over
periods of time measured in years and decades.  And in terms of child
development, patience is a central theme of maturation.  

However, the understanding of structure and boundaries are
increasingly important in a world of communication across the
traditional boundaries of culture and (age) group.  Likewise, theology
is more valuable than religion and philosophy (formal, as in
metaphysics and positivism) is more valuable than doctrine.  A
successful child is one with a capacity for the preservation of
balance and discipline available from parents and applicable to school
and life.
