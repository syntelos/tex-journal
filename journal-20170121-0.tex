\input preamble

The palace of scholarship is the reward of generosity and productivity
and the society of fellowship.  The invariant dictates of trust and
integrity, confidence and fidelity are known as specific and
particular features of the world as opposed to the vagaries of the
behaviors of being that plague a fear of society.  Within this palace
one rules over one's artefacts and powers with the serene benevolence
of the particular grace of scholarship and understanding.
