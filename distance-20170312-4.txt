Dearest Gwyneth,


If you’re asking to come, the answer remains as always, yes, yes, a
thousand times, yes.


Catch me here, catch me there.  Have no fear of it!  What’s the worst
that could happen?  To be caught with a chest full of squirels rather
than eyes full of tears.  Who knows which it will be.  Both?


All I know is that it needs to be like that.  A bit off customary.


All my love,


John
