\input preamble

ï»¿Obviously the ``credit reporting'' concept is profoundly flawed.  The
infrastructure and metaphysics have devolved into a predator's game.
The information value is severely compromised and hyper-exploited.
The resulting macrometaphysics are horrendous.

The concept of consumer credit has deteriorated the economy profoundly
since its inception.  The existence of credit reporting is debatable.

It's entirely plausible that discarding consumer credit and credit
reporting would be superior to alternatives of a relatively
compromising structure.
