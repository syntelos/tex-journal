ï»¿Obviously the ``credit reporting'' concept is profoundly flawed.  The
infrastructure and metaphysics \break have devolved into a predator's
game.  The information value is severely compromised and
hyper-exploited.  The resulting macrometaphysics are horrendous.

The concept of consumer credit has deteriorated the economy profoundly
since its inception.  The existence of credit reporting is debatable.

It's entirely plausible that discarding consumer \break credit and
credit reporting would be superior to alternatives of a relatively
compromising structure.
