\input preamble

The image expresses the pallor of loss.  The style recalls the history
of image related of the AIDS epidemic.  I believe that this has been
applied to the character of public life in media, of the reflection of
the business of mass media, and the state of mass media in
communications.

In film, actors realize story in life.  In front of the camera -- in
the art work -- one is responsible for the voice of the art.

This contribution, and the celebrity of media communications that
contributes to the career of the artist and his medium, should not be
more expensive for film makers than the creation each art work.  But
it is.  We get emotional and stampede the theater at the first sign of
new product.  Or so the story goes.  The story of media and marketing
that is crucial to the scale of projects that some regard as essential
to living in this world.

Would we not be better off to reexamine broadcast media and our
individual contribution to the marketing delivered by mass media.
This writer has suggested that better science would improve everyone's
situation through the elevation of media quality and demand.  A
relatively mature response to media and marketing would change culture
and science and politics and media.  The contributions to general
sanity should be noted.
