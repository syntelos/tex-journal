\input preamble

Katherine posited that the anthropological theory of early human
development (homo erectus) needed to expand the hunter - gatherer
model from a static binary system to a dynamic co-worker concept.

Alternative components include role exchange and specialization of
labor that produce more dynamic models of the couple.

This is far more likely based on our experience with the love binding
in the homo sapien.
