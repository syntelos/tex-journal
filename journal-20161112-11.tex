\input preamble

The easter egg business model balances income against outflow in favor
of the product.  A utility model describes the structure, however
pricing is described by other models.

A hyperbolic trade over costs and benefits (inverse proportion) has
many appearances.  In the internet environment, an experience is a
product that benefits from use that contributes to the experience.
This is as simple as social media and comments and marketing and
commerce, and includes Wikipedia and immersion.
