﻿Oh, this street.  This path.  This road.  This dirt track paved with tulips and daffodils. 


How do you know.  You don’t. 


I come from there, and write till here.  As have texts before me.  The sin in that is less than the glory of learning and more than the crime of ignorance.  It is being and seeming.  No less than that.


Is it not sense.  


There is sense, but then the assumptions that roll through, plowing down those stakes that mark the road under the pillow of a too narrow learning and marked by a too familiar experience.


In this wisdom, not virtue.  In this virtue, not wisdom.


I should not run amuk.


There is a thing to say.  Something to be said.  A perspective.


It is one that accepts without judgement.
