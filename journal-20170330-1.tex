``Do you believe in love?''

``Do I believe that love exists?''

``Yea''

``I think that not believing in spiritual things is just another kind
of denial.  I've had enough denial.  I believe in love.  I believe in
spirituality.  I think that denial out of objectivity and rationality
demonstrates the existence of the spiritual, at least as the existence
of the inner consciousness.''
