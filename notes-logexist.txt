 a deep look into the dynamical consciousness

     the inner consciousness is beyond the resolution of features from
     the outer consciousness (incompleteness), however the two have a
     far more complex relationship than described earlier.

   individual variances

     it's likely that individual genetics determine individual
     properties of the consciousness

   interactions within

     the interactions and sensitivities of the consciousness are
     available to the consciousness

   living structures

     memories and behaviors within the consciousness have lifecycles
     that are available to the consciousness
