     academic (breadth of study) definition

   incompleteness

     Metaphysical Incompleteness, or Heidegger's Incompleteness, can be
     employed to represent uncertainty in temporal ordering and
     indeterminate leaves of knowledge of the metaphysical domain (mind
     and spirit of the homo sapien / instrument of theory and practice).

  language and communication

    instrumentation

      The spirit and mind are the first instruments of theory and
      practice.  This is cause for elucidation identified as
      metaphysics.

      The metaphysial domain has uncertainty and incompleteness.  As a
      result, its analysis is abstract from these issues.  The context
      of language and communication so differs from the objective of
      analysis that the crispness of mathematical logic is subjugated by
      the uncertainty and incompleteness of the human metaphysical
      domain.

      The metaphysical dynamical system may not have an observable
      temporal domain.  In ANW’s Reflections he describes the dynamic of
      self satisfaction deriving a future from a past in a complexity
      (that exists beyond the resolition of the temporal sense of
      process [TBD]).  “Why did I do that?  I don’t know.”.  The process
      of cause cannot be traced because it cannot be ordered
      sequentially according to the demands of language, speech, and
      communication.

    language

      via [ANW/Re] human natural language exists in the metaphysical
      domain (uncertainty in temporality and incompleteness in
      semantics), the pursuit of grammar in natural language
      demonstrates this (abstract) incompleteness.

    thought

      (self evident?)

    knowledge

      representation of [thought]

    communication

      the preservation of [thought] with respect to consciousness

    language 

      the representation of [knowledge] in (degrees of) certainty and
      incertainty and confidence and fuzzyness

    metaphysics 

      the [consideration] of mind and experience with respect to the
      arts and sciences as instrument of theory and measurement

    analysis

      recording and dissecting [thought] as instrument to theory and
      measurement

    philosophy

      a particular [record] of thought in pursuit of reason and humanity


  20170217-0 (language, existentially) would fail this measure as a
             qualification, having focused on elements thought

  20170226-0 (across the history of language) is a nice bracket

  Across the history of language we have developed our arts of
  communication to lead the reader to the comprehension of thought.
  An individual may grasp within the moment of reading (study) a
  concept developed through extensive research.  With such tools of
  development we maintain and develop (and defend!) no less than human
  consciousness.  

  The altitudes of consciousness achieved by humanity are preserved by
  communication, and this is as important and precious as a newborn.
  Technically, as significant as a generation and the generations in
  its future, but the concept overwhelms so the reachable and
  recognizable principle of the one is upheld with this force of human
  faith.

 a deep look into the dynamical consciousness

     the inner consciousness is beyond the resolution of features from
     the outer consciousness (incompleteness), however the two have a
     far more complex relationship than described earlier.

   individual variances

     it's likely that individual genetics determine individual
     properties of the consciousness

   interactions within

     the interactions and sensitivities of the consciousness are
     available to the consciousness

   living structures

     memories and behaviors within the consciousness have lifecycles
     that are available to the consciousness
