 a deep look into the dynamical consciousness

     the inner consciousness is beyond the resolution of features from
     the outer consciousness (incompleteness), however the two have a
     far more complex relationship than described earlier.

   individual variances

     it's likely that individual genetics determine individual
     properties of the consciousness

   interactions within

     the interactions and sensitivities of the consciousness are
     available to the consciousness

   living structures

     memories and behaviors within the consciousness have lifecycles
     that are available to the consciousness

  Across the history of language we have developed our arts of
  communication to lead the reader to the comprehension of thought.
  An individual may grasp within the moment of reading (study) a
  concept developed through extensive research.  With such tools of
  development we maintain and develop (and defend!) no less than human
  consciousness.  

  The altitudes of consciousness achieved by humanity are preserved by
  communication, and this is as important and precious as a newborn.
  Technically, as significant as a generation and the generations in
  its future, but the concept overwhelms so the reachable and
  recognizable principle of the one is upheld with this force of human
  faith.
