  consciousness, framed (@logexist)

  [OUT]

  In this context it is natural and constructive to introduce the frame,
  $\phi$, as the frame or abstraction operator.  An operator is not
  itself an epistemological fact.  As an adjective in the {\it adjective
  - noun} notation, it produces a new fact of epistemological exposition
  when composed with a term that is a metaphysical fact or assertion or
  a scientific hypothetical proposition.  The reference frame first
  appeared in (relativistic) Physics as $\phi\alpha$ meaning the context
  or frame relative to which some logical object represented by the term
  $\alpha$ is a fact or is known.
