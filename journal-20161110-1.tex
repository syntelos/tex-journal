\input preamble

The experiential collusion of the kochtopus dark net would assert by
suggestion and enforce by attrition to death any possible thing that
would turn a man away.  A natural reaction to the vagaries of
experience and social and conventional mores, out of place at work but
present none the less.  The network was extensive enough to assert
death by forces including contracts and labor and a broad range of
dark actors.

Barack taught me of things I had witnessed but only vaguely clustered
around the concept of a dark net.  The idea familiar to art and
journalism.  Further to import, significant to the government and
constitution of the United States.  

Through this journey with a sitting president, I came to label the
dirty dozen as ``whore'' for their absolute lack of merit in standing
before the concept of absolute power for money.  They spoke in money,
a language clear enough in context.

Today we see a president elect standing in front of these concepts.  I
can't call them ideas for their lack of merit in context.

The country speaks true.  The country speaks my language.  This will
not stand.  It is unacceptable.  We will handle it one way or another.
Ideally we will replace this person with another.  

Clearly we need Clinton.
