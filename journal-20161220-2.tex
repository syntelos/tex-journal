\bf {essential edo}

\rm {\it Edo6} interpreted XML documents in nested data code.  The
software system was necessarily a knot.  The context originated with
the server, and was inherited by applications, resources, and
processes.  

\rm An XML document having the parent and child nodes \ {\tt
X:proc} \ and {\tt data:abc} can be read into instances of classes
{\tt X} or {\tt data}.

\rm When executed the function \ {\tt Out proc (data.Abc);} \ in
class X is called.

\rm The reading into data objects and processing of data functions are XML
system calls.  The java process runs an XML document to run a server
on a level of abstraction analogous to {\it node js}.
