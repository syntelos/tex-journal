``For some reason, we have lost what empathy we had.  And it's really
important that we don't let that set in.  Because these people are not
`other.'  They are us.  These are people who previously sent their
kids to school.  People who have dreams about the future.  Kids who
want to be in a classroom.  It could be any of us.''
