ï»¿There's a difference between seeing and believing that's
interpretation.  Without the distinction, fact.  \break With the
process of differentiation, fiction.

The inner conscious, $\alpha$, could be described as the genetic proof
of the fairness of occasion on the analog computer of life.  It is the
moral fabric which demands peace, and the conscience that demands
dignity.

The outer consciousness, $\beta$, faces the world.  It is the most
familiar conception of consciousness, intellect.

The mind's eye, or third eye, is above the inner and behind the outer.
It is not a center of consciousness, but a component of the system of
consciousness.  It closes to darken the interior, and opens to light
the interior.  With this light, the heart opens and rejoices.  Joy.

Without this light, the intellect is relatively cold and distinct from
the moral fabric of being -- the web of the inner consciousness and
its derivation throughout the system of consciousness into the
esoterica of consciousness including conscience.

The history of our conception of our metaphysical world is short of
the realization of our actuality.  We remain immersed in the
indulgence of mystery in comparison with a self awareness proportional
to our physical technologies.
