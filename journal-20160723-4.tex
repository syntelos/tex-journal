\input preamble

I get so excited at the prospect of getting to know a woman I love.
For me, the experience itself is worth the time spent.  I could spend
my life in that.  That's the thing, isn't it?  To spend all your time
with another.  To give yourself to another.  That's what it's all
about, the human existence.  Other things are done to bring new
experience home.  The other things make a contribution as a matter of
course, but the reward I can't live without is love.

Like this, waiting, I have a need to meet all that in some sense.  In
any way I can find.  Like this.

I blather on with stuff not worth ink.  Observations without
comprehension.  No matter to it.  Frustration with not understanding
others.  Frustration with the lack of speech, communication, sharing.
We'd all be better off if we had a better experience of each other.

It gets a bit teenage, but that's a good thing.  That age when our
psychological forces smash us into each other.  A lot of people have
the habit of that kind of interconnection.  The reticence in my
character, the drive to competent self representation, has me sitting
in my own chair.  It's hard, but it's always been that way.  Since
before I could speak.
