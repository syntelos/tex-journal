\input preamble

What's in a name?  In this case, not much.  The Telephone Prison
System also could be called Salt Life.  It's subliminal.  In real life
it doesn't have a name.  It's a phenomenon in need of a name.  

Not everyone who goes to the beach to fish or swim or surf knows Salt
Life as something misogynistic.  And not everyone who plays weird
psychological games with others knows that it can lead into
complications that I identify as the Telephone Prison System.

With boys and girls, from mature singles to children, capturing a
member of the partner sex can lead into a kind of trap or ponzi scheme
of ownership that can be terrifying.  Normal behavior can be
castigated viciously.  That is, not participating in a continuous
process of play and the enforcement of play can produce severe
inflictions of pain from ostracism to harassment as normally produces
thoughts of suicide.
