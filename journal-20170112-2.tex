\input preamble

When he had had enough of not looking into her eyes, Gerard pulled
back and opened his eyes.  Despite the late hour of the day his being
was puffy with the emergence of consciousness.  Through this fog he
found her eyes where he expected to find them, with her nose almost
touching his.  They both smiled simultaneously and his blood rose
within his self to a gleeful joy.  His smile broadened and with it his
heart.  He took her hand in his and her beaming smile filled his soul
till the forces within him forced the capitulation of a break in the
moment.  Let's get something to eat, he spoke.  Like a prophecy he
suddenly felt light-headed and depleted.  Her smile changed into an
acknowledgement and her hand squeezed his.  He turned toward the door
in a half step and she followed.  Another step and they were walking
to the door which he opened with his free hand.  As the door was
opening a rush of pride of presence took hold within.  He was so in
love with her and it appeared as an aura that enveloped the pair of
them.
