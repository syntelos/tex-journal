\input preamble

The product of the public exploitation system bears no resemblance to
a public interest, stewardship in partnership public or private.  The
individual characterized by disassembly, deception, and denial is not
equipped to conceive of social issues.  Horizons open to
communication.  Horizons closed by ignorance and intimidation.  And
the well being of others as vital and virtuous.
