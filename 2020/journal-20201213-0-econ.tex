\input preamble

Our history with propaganda has been damaging.  The propulsion and
propagation of social force with ideological hooks has betrayed us as
a people with a system of law.

We should forget the terms of exploitation: Capitalism, Communism.
Objects of economic theory with only thin relevance to the issues we
need to deal with in politics and government.  Those objects of theory
are harnessed to obscure the disposition of wealth in the shadows of
insecurity.

There is no competition between economic benefit and public good.

The system of law formally known as government is in the business of
managing the {\it public good}.  Our mutual sustenance.  When we lose
sight of the substance and significance of society and government
(population and economics) in favor of individual insecurity and fear
we squander the future as tomorrow's present as we have squandered
today and yesterday.
