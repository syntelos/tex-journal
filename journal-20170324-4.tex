\input preamble-png

﻿Disbelief and denial exist, today, as infidelity to the mind-body
identity, unity, the breath of life.  This infidelity manifests
through the suspicious rationality that would substitute objectivity
for subjectivity, science for art, ideology for thought, conformity
for creativity.  The rationalization of identity betrays the self, the
breath of life, the will to dispose of the gift of life according to
one’s thoughts and senses and ambitions.  

And it follows, directly, that the rationalization of economy betrays
humanity.  However, this is the ultimate conclusion of a line of
thought from the individual as a mind-body identity and a
socio-economic identity who participates in any of an infinite variety
of ways in the spiritual and material dimensions of existential
manifestation.
