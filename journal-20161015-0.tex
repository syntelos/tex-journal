\input preamble

A child watches the world pass by, in front of the window of the car.
Mesmerized.  What is this place.  What goes on.  Are they really so
convinced of the rigidity of their plastic reality?

It's so comforting, the breeze.  Watching it pass by as the thought
flies over head.  A kite.  Out of mind.  In the wind.

Now we know how to move those mountains, how to change the wind, that
that plastic is as flexible as the child knows it.
