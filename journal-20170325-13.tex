It is surprising how many will throw themselves into the appearance of
such an unknown.  Some of these may perceive the frustration of their
rationality, and that inner consciousness asserts the frustration into
plain view.  Some others of these may perceive the appearance of their
rationality, and that inner consciousness asserts the object into
plain view.  

Whatever the case may be, the erect existence is often met with such
perceptual violences spoken from within.  In consciousness, one meets
these according to choice or habit.  There is no inherent superiority
to the appearance of grace excepting the benefits of the appearance of
distance.  Engagement is preferable, when possible.  But, very often,
it is not.  It is impractical spiritually or materially, or both.
