\input preamble

A psychology of objectivity has a triage in sanity, inanity, and
insanity; and a diagnosis in expression of intent by the presence of
intention.

Its individual relevance is to identify metaphysical fidelity and
fairness to self, other, and society.  The condition of one's fidelity
to fairness of self, other, and society is a substance of merit in an
epistemological psychology.  It is independent of physical and
metaphysical expression so as to envelop behavioralism.

Its social relevance is in the presence of our sustenance and the
distinction of expression.  It maintains fidelity and fairness over
situation in microscopic and macroscopic perspectives.
