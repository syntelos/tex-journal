\input preamble

At times one stops, grabs and inspects the emotions one is feeling --
slows or suspends a flow of emotional energy -- and questions
experience.

That you are here, that my experience of love is not material, and
that this strange territory is true.

For everything has fingerprints.  The most literal a band and a
microphone -- a grip to grasp the scent -- a predator and prey.  Pray.
Pray for forgiveness known, but further that no forgiveness is needed.
We're playing.  It's O.K..  You have given me their knowledge of me,
tied and packed just so.  Ethereal, eternal, in any century known.  In
fiction and non-fiction according to my mind.  My voice lifted high.
High enough to fly.
