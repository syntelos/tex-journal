\input preamble

It's a simple story, my love life.  Fumbling around in the dark until
the one that got me truly, madly, deeply.  And fairly bumbling since.
Like stories of the kind, its moments were populated by smiles and
nods and too few words.  Human action, the stuff of evolution.

The shock of my earliest romantic experiences was the discovery, in
women, of materialism.  It was violent for my captivated little mind
to see the feminine associated with the religion of objectivism.
Which is admittedly bizarre as my own mother is a fair example of the
kind.  But that's childhood and the meeting of the inner with the
outer that the journey affords.  Deep within, far away from the world,
the male was objective and the female subjective.  A simple picture
that represented something deeper.  A lesson well learned many times.
I've since learned of love as a subjective divinity worthy of
uncompromising exploration and discovery.  A very long journey.  All
of life.
