\input preamble

{\it Where was that?  That was the shit.}

{\it That was the suck.}

Because if you believe in this, and do that, then you've committed a
crime.  

{\it I'm really uncomfortable crying about the horror of war when it's so
particular.}

But the interior doesn't know of such things.  Abstract things.  It
sees with the earlier eyes.  It is the earlier me.  From any age since
the conspiracy of the birth canal.

{\it Conspiracy?}

{\it Ouais.  Pourquoi pas?}

{\it Um, how about experential memory that intersects with that of others
for odd effects?}

{\it Odd effects?!  Phobia of constriction.  What's it called.}

And ultimately, everyone believes in this.  Humanity.  This is the
beauty of humanity, the enlightenment, the knowing of self.  Awareness
of self. Self awareness.

And now we have found a social self awareness. 

{\it Yes, and many got hurt.  }

{\it Most in less than a loss of some minor convenience.  Some lost face
and hearth to the loss of mind.}

{\it Because they needed to.  They were killing their mother.  And their
ancestors.  And, with the power and implications at hand, the planet.
Humanity.}

{\bf When I sleep -- in my bed -- I cry for the horror of what I've seen.}
