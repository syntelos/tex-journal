The micrometaphysial being has a structure of aperture, the mind’s
eye.  It looks within or without, opens and closes.  It is reasonable
to assume that it emerges within consciousness open, and the pains of
development are the learning of aperture direction and closing.  The
evidence of such deductions, individually, lies within a capacity for
the endurance of similar effects including advanced learning,
dissonance, and dissociation.

The objects of psychic obstruction are objects known within as foreign
to the aperture of consciousness.  As adults, a practice of self
awareness typically illuminates a process of identification and
characterization for the handling of psychic obstruction.  Another,
entirely related metaphor is the walking through of doors.  The
identification of the doorway may be introspective, as described
above, or extrospective.  One must always walk through one’s
obstructions, into awareness, and emerge into the light of
consciousness.  These profits to health are fairly self evident,
especially to a practitioner of self awareness.
