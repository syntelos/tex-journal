\input preamble

﻿The look had said, ``Oh, hello there''.  His friend.  He was happy to
see her.  A woman.  He always enjoyed the way women felt.  Compared to
men, women posed a greater liklihood of entertaining conversation.
That women had a full range of awareness, ground to sky, was obvious.
That his experience was typically shellaced in the meanderings of
sexuality, less so.  His own desire for society had outgrown his
interest in subterranean distemper such that it held little memory.
So it was a recurring mystery to him that others should so often lack
the economy of purpose that makes for reasonable interaction.  Age is
a wonder.  A constant fountain of rewards in exchange for a constant
loss of longevity.

Experience grows the mind.  Each decade it grows more complex, and the
effects of that complexity are as unimaginable as almost anything
could be.  Perhaps the figures of extraterrestrial life are less
predictable.  It is the outcome of multiplying enormous complexity by
great veins of subtlety.  It’s a huge space, that void.  Its
development, the entering into self awareness, consciousness,
experience, training and discipline a better solution to the problem
of what to do with this breath of life than most others.  Perhaps
divine companionship a better one, although one without the other
especially rare.
