\input preamble

I was sad to finish Camilla's book.  I think that the last third got
so breezy because it should have been much longer.  I could have taken
five hundred pages of that.  But I suppose that would have been a bit
heavy.  And then there's the dream, perhaps.  Brought me to a new
appreciation of audience.  And more importantly a new appreciation of
politics and country.
