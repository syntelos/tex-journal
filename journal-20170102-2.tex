\input preamble

Jacob and Teresa walked down Wall Street past the Flatiron to Early
Girl and opened a lost door onto a pirate deck.  Sitting on a stone
firm foundation over the South Slope they jacked into the community
mesh net and headed into the stacks.  ``Found him''.  The tutor was
there, as usual, working on some bit of this or that.

``John?'', asked Teresa.

``Yes?'', he responded to the couple.

``How's craft?'', she replied.

``Craft is good.''.

They signed into the system and went looking for new books.  Teresa
and Jacob had first met John last week.  They asked his view on a
topic they were researching, just to kick the leaves out of the trees.
He responded with a relatively sophmoric dissection, but the force of
his interaction and prompt presence were worth the time.  They found
his system interesting, and were still exploring.  They sought
information about Molecular Fabrication.  They didn't ask him where it
was, and he didn't offer answer number one.  They might enjoy looking
around randomly in very large spaces.  Eventually they'll find their
way, or ask a relevant question.
