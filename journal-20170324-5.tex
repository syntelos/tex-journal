\input preamble-png

Throughout the millenia, the subjugation of the individual has met
with failure.  In this past millenium we turned into the problem, and
eventually arrived at the solution.  The individual can no more be
subjugated by another as by itself.  

There is an inner consciousness that demands peace and love and
respect and dignity.  It is independent of the intellect and
objectivity of the outer consciousness, which can hear its voice.
Indeed, others can hear its voice.  It is the origin of the force of
life, and it is the fountain of the energy of life.  It is the subject
of the pages of history.
