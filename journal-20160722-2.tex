\input preamble

The experience of an atmospheric social intercourse is embedded in the
imagination.  A romantic social intercourse in the air can be cruel.
The female readily dominates in a culture that values the feminine art
of romantic intercourse over the masculine.  Degrees and orientations
of this art vary as widely as individuals.  The cultural standards
employed by young adults can be crutches that obscure feelings and
variety and exploration.
