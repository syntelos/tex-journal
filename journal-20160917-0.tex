\input preamble

A squirrel leaps from a trunk to a sapling.  A countertop with maple
syrup.  Sasafras.  Honey graham crackers and peanut butter.  Sweet red
raspberry sauce.  

He ascends the sapling and wags his tail, the way squirrels do.  I
imagine his vitality and spirit say or ask for acknowledgement.  I
speak to him in his ear.  I say, yes, you are beautiful.  

He hears me and runs over the ground to another sapling which he leaps
upon sideways, rotates himself through a polar arc and runs over the
top of it like a happy monkey.  

He reaches a powerline and reaches out to it.  He crosses the thin
branches to the wire and runs its length into leaves green, yellowed
and orange.  His own colors territorial, he is not not as dark as coal
dusted like his cousin a mile away.  But he his happy like his cousin
a mile away.  They report good news.  People are happy.  Calm.  Well
rested and vital.  

Humans, birds, and wasps.
