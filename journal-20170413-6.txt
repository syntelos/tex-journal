Madame Selene racks her knuckles from her seat before the crystal
ball.  Her arms in air before her intimate audiences, her palms part,
her arms extend from elbows to lift the air.  Her chin rises, eyes
close.  The crystal rises.

Eyes widen, searching sight.  Only Selene and ball are visible.  Faces
flush as pulses leap and blood sinks.  Selene has the room.
