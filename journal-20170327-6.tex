\input preamble-png

The ``I/O dine'', reflection code.  Differentiate ``inductive'' mode
of \break speech from ``reflective'' mode of speech to find a rotation of
intellect that brings peace to the aggressive frame of thought.
Differentiate complexity from simplicity.  Require sanity and safety
and distance.  Require sanity and peace and love.  Require sanity and
honor of life in breath.
