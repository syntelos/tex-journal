\input preamble

I found Jung.  That is, I found what I would need to bring to Jung.

Freud delivers science to psychology with a model of fundamental
forces that is visible through the basics.  Beyond that, I was
wondering what are the psychological forces that drive my higher
aesthetics.  

I don't find extrapolations of Freud along the lines of Darwinian
fitness functions satisfying in the realm of healthy and positive
psychological forces.  Evolutionary adaptation is interesting in the
study of DNA, and would be interesting in far more advanced studies of
mind than are currently possible.  That would not deal with these
forces for generations to come, and a great deal of complexity would
intervene.

As a matter of course we prepare a metaphysical background.  This is
where I expect to find Jung.  Whether or not he's there is in the
reading.
