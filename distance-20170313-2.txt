There had been a bathroom, there.  A four inch tile wall, bathtub,
molded.  I was spraying the showerhead on the grey mold, trying to
clean it.  I wanted to use this bathroom.  But there was nothing more
than a room, sheetrock, flat medium grey paint traced with outlines of
bath fixtures.  Without plumbing.
