\input preamble

While I don't have here, in my van, a wealth of material to cover the
subject with great breadth and depth, I will say that the BREXIT is
wrong.

The common market ensures efficiencies for Britain and Europe that are
economically substantial and important for everyone, everywhere. 

From my own distance I know that the complex history of the United
Kingdom has contributed to the politicization of a r\^ole in the EU.

The same efficiencies that are vital to the economy of the United
Kingdom have become vital again in a larger sense, in a global sense.

The region of Western Europe includes the United Kingdom, in this
sense.  The common infrastructure needs only the support of law for
vital economic harmony.
