She walked by the window each morning.  And each morning he would
appear.  She forgot how many times she walked that path.  How many
years had it been, that he would be there, cleaning a table or her
favorite, wiping the glass.  Always a glance.  Specific and personal
and caring.  Kind.  Sometime, a long time ago, the understanding of
compassion gave way to the understanding of love.  Romantic love.  And
each day that the glass stood between them was a recommittment to be
there again tomorrow.  There was no other choice for him, and for her
she would only know the time had come when it had passed.
