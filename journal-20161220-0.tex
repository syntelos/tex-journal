\input preamble

Barack had acted to protest the senselessness of the politics of money
and power {\it cum} the politics of vitriol and hate.

Gwyneth had acted to support my {\it ego} driven campaign of love.

I had acted for all of the above, desperate to exit the ambiguity and
politics and violence that had ruined my life.  I suppose it worked
out well enough.  If this is the point it needed to arrive to, and the
analog computer of real life says so, then it worked out as it needed
to.
