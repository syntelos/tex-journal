\input preamble

If we define delusion as an inability to assign well reasoned
significances to the facts and artefacts of experience, we may elect
to define temporary and chronic delusion.  

In the case of temporary delusion, we may identify the contribution of
incertainty or cognitive dissonance, and differentiate these with the
intellectual capacity for confidence and social bearings including
trust.

In the case of chronic, long term delusion we may elect to first
accept an incapacity for confidence and social and then differentiate
these from mental faculties that would cause the patient to distrust
itself so profoundly.
