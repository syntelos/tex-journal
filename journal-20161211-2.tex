\input preamble

Thomas turned the boat he built to sea, filling the sail that hung
over the wide beam that he needed for fishing.  He pulled the gaffing
spar high to flatten the sheet and head up wind.  The sea was cold.
It was almost always cold.  Rarely warm.  He would return this evening
with the fish that would feed and clothe his family, as he did each
day.  They knew he would return each day, as his father before him,
and his father before him.  They built the boats, sailed the boats,
and fished the fish that did well at the market.  Only one was needed
to finish a day poorly, and three to finish a day well.  Either
outcome good enough to bring him home on time and in his ready health.

His hands tied the gaffing line to its pins while his mind chased the
schools that fed him.  He watched the wind and sky in the space over
his head and under his mast, as a sailor does, with life in hand.  It
would be some time before he would need to think about the fish again.
The peace of work and wind and wave took him into his thoughts.  He
set on the gunwale with his oil skin to the wet like a king.  His wife
would be feeding his children their breakfast cereals as he watched
the sun begin to touch the eastern horizon.  The last gust from the
shore lifted him.  The beard began to wet.  The eyes narrowed.

An hour passed and he laid in his first line.  He fed it out over the
transom into the eternal wake behind him.
