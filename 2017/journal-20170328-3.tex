``We have the habit of not discussing it.''

``We have such a habit of avoiding our own discomfort that we've
become slaves to it.  Slaves to comfort.  Slaves to a world of comfort
that's so unhealthy as to be most acccurately described as the
perversion of comfort, the perversion of the status quo.''

``In the sense that we've become slaves to society in place of the
recognition that the health and well being of society depends on the
health and well being of the individual.''

``Yes, and that the health and well being of the individual with
respect to these social issues is primarily a matter of education.''

``Education is the gap between the haves and the have-nots.''

``Yes.  Of course.  The facts and understandings that differentiate
the world of yesterday from the world of today.''

``And the world of tomorrow.''

``Well, let's catch up with the twentieth century before we go off
exploring.''
