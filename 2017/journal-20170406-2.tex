\input preamble-png

ï»¿The vacuum of image, school language, comes with the peril of
remaining unexpressed, unrealized.  It is not a weapon.  It is, by
definition, out of hand.

And by necessity of its endlessness, the copying of each statement
into its translation, or into a process of correction, explodes.
