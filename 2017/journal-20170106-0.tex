\input preamble

Sophie used the artificial orbital science data system with the
orbital navigation scenario planning system in her wave rider to solve
Gerard's network problem.  His dataset accumulated network modeling
output into unit automaton credit and deficit figures.  Sophie came up
with a spectrum of possibilities which she plotted over a manifold of
lunar time on orbit, and network benefit.  She gave Gerard a contour
map with a pair of lumps for vacation time.  Either orbit had its
blessings, and maximizing timee in one rather than cislunar space was
a spiritual preference that they shared.
