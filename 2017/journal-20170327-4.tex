﻿What would be a theory of fashion.  What would be a theory of woman's
clothing.  What would be a theory of men’s clothing.  And beyond that,
what would this woman wear.

Why does she wear that.  Is there a compromise.  Is it in a
preparation for a moment, or the manner of the moment.  Is a moment.

It seems to me that women live in the space between the ground and the
sky while men do not.  Few men, so few, achieve an altitude in
proportion.

That's not the kind of thing one should say out loud in a typical
conception of Reality.  But compromising ourselves to Reality is not
even remotely healthy.
