\input preamble

Gerard woke to thoughts about the life of a graduate student, and how
his life was unlike the life of a graduate student.  In the five years
since he completed his thesis he had grown comfortable in the campaign
against his own ignorance.  He could consume a day of work without
notice.  A graduate student is still building the intellectual muscle,
still feeling the work and relatively buried under the effort.  In
this sense the relationship that promised to continue tonight would be
found on some uneven territory.  He was feeling old.  Older than her.
He was thirty and she would probably not yet be twenty five.  He
packed himself into some clothes and walked out the door wondering if
it would work, wondering if the differences between them would betray
his heart and cause him the legendary pain of divorce.  The shook off
the thought as fear of the unknown and self indulgence.  He didn't
need to dig that deep to see that he loved her, and to know that life
was as simple as that.
