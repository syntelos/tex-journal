ï»¿Conscious intent has art.  Ideally, peace.  Possibly, reflection.
Speech from intent is coherent.  The cries from an inner consciousness
denied are possessed of an incoherence that is disturbing to the point
of absurd.  This is what we mean by incoherent.  The incomprehensible
by manner of abjection.

By conscious we intend the honor and respect of life, each breath.  It
could have a kind of violence when it intends some alternative
reflection, when it demands reflection.  But that representation, that
expression that speaks with recognizable intent is coherent in the
colors of life and breath and peace and love.
