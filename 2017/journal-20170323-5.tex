\input preamble-png

A joined existence in the primacy of being, where touch and word heal
with the capacity of self, where love can touch and life can breathe.
Where one is missing and always found.  

This self breathes, and in this way communicates.  The languages of
the couple suffer neither substance nor separation.  R\^{o}le
characterizations and differentiations have given way to the primacy
of being.  

A character of being suited to a realm of thought, and not of the
world.
