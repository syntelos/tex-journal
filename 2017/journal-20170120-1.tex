\input preamble

For me, the fellowship of Christ recognizes the available outline of
the historical fact of the story of the life of Jesus and the
historical impact of the historical fact.  A mathematical logic is
readily derived from this fact and impact, existential tests, and
human capacity and facility to arrive at the affirmation of shared
principles.  I enjoy the fact that this ``belief'' makes me a theist
capable of defeating the atheist in the classic existential
theological debate, and the joy of fellowship that I would enjoy with
those who would recognize and accept and enjoy the discussion of such
a theological position.  I am not incapable of enjoying the atheist
debate with a good sport.  In brief, a nihilistic rejection of
compassion becomes irrelevant under the acceptance of the historical
fact of impact.  And, the capacity to argue the nihilistic rejection
of compassion would tend to admit the basic historical facts.
