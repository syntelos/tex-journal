\input preamble

Unlike Gerard, Sophie was entirely content to live on the fruits of
her labors.  She went to school to complete her childhood interest in
Molecular Fabrication.  In return, she contributed to the community
periodically with developments in Instrumentation and Fabrication.
She had repaid the gift of education many times over, and continued to
give everything she had.

Gerard's interests took him to another stage, one that depended on
facilities he could not always realize single handedly.  A radio
telescope or an orbit.  That Sophie should be so adept with orbits was
another of a million reasons he had for his being (perhaps) a bit too
dedicated to her.
