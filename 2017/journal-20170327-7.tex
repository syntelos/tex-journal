\input preamble-png

ï»¿A little one points and looks.  Her mother tells her to use her words.
She looks.  She recognizes and knows.

In her future there will be confusion.  Those who have noisy minds,
restless souls, crying eternally.  Those will try to get in her eyes,
their consciousness pleading for attention.  They will feign
hostility.  The clothing put on will be aggressive.  Indefensible, it
is aggressive.

Today she learns that peace of mind in voice of expression and
knowledge of recognition.  The languages of mind and body and
reflection are understood.  Some are recognizable, some can speak with
a unique intent.
