\input preamble

Sophie rose first.  She went to the galley and prepared coffee.  She

a morning person.  He drifted across the floor from the aft bunk.  He
found the back of her neck with his head, and managed to plant one on
target.  His arms wrapped around her.  She held his embrace to herself
and closed her eyes.
