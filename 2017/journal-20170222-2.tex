\input preamble

The finest element of thought within the study and practice of the
martial arts of the United States is an officers sense of judgement.
Each commissioned officer has a responsibility and obligation to the
judgement of execution.  The concept is subject to the chain of
command, cognisance, and international and military law.  

That each individual has a unique knowledge of law and capacity for
reason and judgement places the domain in a metaphysical, human realm.
Furthermore, the military establishment has an {\it unknown known}
sense of career and individual.  That is, the individual relies on
divine intervention upon occasion.  Having said as much, the officer
is expected to perceive the situation as unambiguous.  

A decision to execute, $\delta$, is composed of so many elements,
perhaps law, $\lambda$, cognisance, $\kappa$, and perhaps exigency,
$\beta$.  $$ \delta = \lambda + \kappa + \beta.$$  The crucial
elements require maturity and practice which are proportional to rank
and placement.
