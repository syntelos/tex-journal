You're not concerned with the development of the couple and the
malignment of the individual?  Sophie asked Gerard.

I'm betting that the destruction of psychology covers all that and
more.  Gerard replied.

So then we're building a couple as the balance of each self with the
joined self.  Sophie conjected.

Yes.  I think that a couple formed from two individuals who are
lifelong practitioners of self balance is incapable of the malignment
of either or both individuals for much more than a hundred
milliseconds.  Gerard countered.

Have you read much Gefou?  Sophie asked.

No.  I haven't really read any Gefou.  Just a vague awareness.  Gerard
replied.

Oh, no!  Well, I love Gefou.  I've read plenty of her work.  I
shouldn't say plenty.  I should say some.  But I find it
authoritative.  Sophie replied.

You're saying it concludes the metaphysical line of inquiry.  Gerard
posited.

Yea.  Her capture of the distinction between effect and utility almost
propelled me into a career in metaphysics.  I could throw those knives
all day long.  Sophie proposed.

Um.  Ok.  You lost me.  Gerard paused and reflected.  Utility and
effect of knowledge development over time scales long and short.  Got
it.  Gerard repled.

Oh, you are a quick one.  Sophie smiled.  Gerard, I'm done.  She
continued.
