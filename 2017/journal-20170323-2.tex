\input preamble-png

The practice of existence, being, has its unique independence from the
experience of existence.  

The practice of art, expression and voice, has dependence on the
experience of existence.  Art is an existential manifestation, as is
material life.

When the realization of the social individual in the material domain
is balanced with the realization of the individual mind-body identity
in the spiritual domain, being is found to be the foundation under the
instrument that experiences and expresses.  

This is the consciousness of being and sensing.

% And, the prerequisite to the practice of subjective logic as a
% discipline.
