\input preamble

At thanksgiving it's true but not the thought that counts.  It's love
but not to be taken so lightly as to not include my body.  It's
precious and worthwhile and the entirely human intercourse of man and
wife.  It's pleasure and pain to such a degree as madness induces to
heaven sent.  It's respect and admiration and jealousy and rage as
subject to the degree of care necessary to every selfish safety and
security in the preservation of trust.

It's gentle and quiet that knows no greater care of self in same.
It's love as known in our own ethereal rarities where spirit of soul
transcends spirit of consciousness.  It's birth and death and
everything between as presence of thought and feeling condensed to one
and another.  It's implausible.  A mystery.  Human.  A thing of faith
so high expressed in part by the faithlessness that tests the other.
