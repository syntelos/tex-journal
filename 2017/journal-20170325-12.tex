To not encounter the obstruction of frustration one must exist within
the cause of spirit.  This is the inner consciousness.  One comes from
within the inner consciousness and ejects the obstructa known to the
outer consciousness.

This exercise marks the completion of the practice of the art of the
balancing of centers of consciousness, senses, and ambitions.
