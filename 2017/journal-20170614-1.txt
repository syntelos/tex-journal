For the micrometaphysical utility of communication,


υκ = υα + υβ + υγ + υδ + υσ ,


we describe a profit within υψ as υψ > υσ and a loss within υψ as υψ < υσ .  Likewise, we may describe a profit within υψ as υψ > υγ .  An informational utility is positive when υψ > υγ + υδ .  Therefore, informational utility is υα + υβ + υσ .  And, sensual utility is υα + υβ + υδ + υσ .


When


υψ < υα


the income from experience is a loss.  In the early twenty first century we are finding this common to the state of being βγσ in the case of relatively senseless, inane, or irrelevant habits of metaphysical consumption and interaction.  This βγσ represents a state of being we can describe as “lost in macrometaphysical space”.  When we experience communication as synthetic experience but not recognized as fiction, or fictive, or fictional, we are in the κψ subspace βγσ but not αβγσ.  This subspace is detached from, and not relevant to the whole mind-body unity.  The pathology is well known.  Conversely, βγσ does not exist without cause.  The closed mind is defensive, it fights without reason or sense until confronted with depth, and then dies.


The value of βγσ is less than αβγσ, which is the reason why the breath of life is maximized by maximizing
