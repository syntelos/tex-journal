ï»¿Ricard had travelled across the lunar surface without purpose or
intent other than to elapse time in a way that settled his being.
Letting the rover travel in search of some ground that it had not yet
seen was the best way he had available.  He had only enough force of
will to require it to maximize distance travelled from Helen.  While
the gesture was objectively self destructive, it served peace by
isolation.  It actualized peace by a false realization.  And this
dichotomy displaced intellect.  It delivered peace from time.

He had not spoken or written to Helen since Lucille had died.  They
had decided, together, that Ricard would scatter Lucille's ashes.
Helen and Lucille knew him well.  Lucille had brought him into this
world, and Helen had brought his children into this world.  And when
Lucille would pass, Ricard would collapse.  He would need a trek, a
walkabout, to find himself in this world without her presence.
