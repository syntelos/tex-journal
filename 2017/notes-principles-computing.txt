  operational logic, or mathematical logic and object oriented
  programming

    the domains reachable from mathematical logic are only partially
    reachable from object oriented programming

    are finer details available via computing on a larger scale as
    across the network?

    mathematical objects as host:port identities may exist or not and
    then possess arbitrary features finer than fields and methods.
