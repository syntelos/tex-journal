\input preamble

It happened that way.  The ring ``code'' signified my own simplicity.
And a spot of humor as well.  The magnitude of scale combined that
with a degree of certainty or magnificence.  And then there she was.
And it became grandeur.  Enough to meet.  Far more than enough to
meet.  And then things to talk about.  Intimacies that could,
conceivably, deliver comfort or repulsion.  Initialisation of choice
that was discarded.  The meet became certainty.  And with time the
ring code solidified to represent the depths of my sense of the
potential.  Then joined it became a commitment.  And that commitment
became the certainty we would otherwise describe as marriage, save the
abstraction.  Then the abstraction fell away, lost to the knowledge of
the thing we were joined a mated pair lacking reservation or
revocation.  A metaphysical thing as certain as a physical thing is
not a thing as known to language, it is a person as known to language.
A person with rights and responsibilities and known to the world that
knows us, as I'm compelled to record.
