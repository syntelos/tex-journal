\input preamble-png

The perversity of intelligence.  Of not knowing, but writing in
description.  Is it description.  It needs another label, title.
Fiction.  It is fictive.  It is figmentary.  Fragmentary.  Not the
scene and its discord, but the how and the why of it.  That it comes
from one tiny little mind, tortured into the passing of gas.  Tortured
to the writing of text.  This is what they see, what they act out,
represent, in their actions.  The children whose voices fill the
night.  Who refuse to be seen.  Who, by this description, are not
there.  Another sound, another word.  Another cold chill runs down the
spine of it.

Some sound that lost sight of the fiction.
