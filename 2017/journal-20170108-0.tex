\input preamble

The construction network, STC, mined the asteroids for material and
the system for energy in the objective program to deploy a star scale
communications network.  The sphere of STC nodes at one light year
diameter repeated signals captured through long and very long baseline
interferometry over its surface.  The STC maintained repeater rings
throughout Sol, and included the AFA/PN among its own without
distinction external to the ownership and access bags.  The signals
economy in artificially occupied space provided available bandwidth
over distance to the cosmos.  The ethereal advance first most sensible
to the physical economy of earth.
