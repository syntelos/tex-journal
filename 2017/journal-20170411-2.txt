The mantle of power has been an infectious disease in this country,
and not a complement to world history.

The arc of history was in a state of divergence.  Our public sphere,
our collective metaphysical space, was mutated into a foul and
wretched form.  Our academic, government, and industrial worlds
suffered horribly in a metaphysical malaise of immersion.  Few
addressed the issue while most wandered in a desert of confused states
of hypocrisy.

In our present realization of social self awareness, that is,
collective awareness, global leadership was in the hands of artists
who protested in available terms to produce products that achieved in
art what our souls aspired to.

The United States, in particular, should possess a collective
coherency of politics and media that permits, rather than offends, an
individual sense of joy.

The failures of our collective structures of government and academia
and industry have been monumental.  Their traces on history eternal.
Humanity will study the hypocrisies of the twentieth century as a
violent emergence of a technological state of being, as a metaphysical
incapacity and incompetence.  We were no better than metaphysical
children toying with adult physics, and it was all we could do to
prevent our collective self destruction.
