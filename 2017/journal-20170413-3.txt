We are not naïve when we approach the limit of our acuity.  We may be
compromised by the horizons of our comprehension that demand
satisfaction.  There is no shame in this looking into a mystery not
knowing a story.  There is only shame in knowing better and doing less
such as to wield power against others as compromising of dignity,
destructive.  To run through life feigning ignorance for pleasure’s
sake.
