\input preamble

As morning broke the eastern horizon from the anonymity of night, the
wave rider glowed like an opaque milky quartz teaming with strands of
micah and pyrite.  Sophie turned on her side to look out through a
transparent slice in the wall.  It was no mistake that her ship was
colored like the horizon over Beaucatcher Mountain right now.  The
micah and quartz in the ground matched the colors in the oceanic
skies, here.  It was foreign to Luna, her orbital perspective, but
then it was always home.  A return to lunar orbit was nearby.  A good
idea.
