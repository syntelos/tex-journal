\input preamble

Carl walked home over the lake thinking of Gerard.  It was always
Gerard who would put a couple stitches in the ways and means to keep
things moving.  He and Sophie a special miracle among the heros who
lent their support to AOS.  The appreciation of life was heightened by
the steady and reliable dependence on the AOSC at large.  That one of
their own -- known in person -- should perform this vital r\^ole a
pleasure to participate in.  Carl was an aquanaut, himself.  He
enjoyed the life under the surface of the lake -- in West Asheville,
as he called it.
