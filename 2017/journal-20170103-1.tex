\input preamble

Sophie's thoughts about a return to the moon had shifted overnight.
Time spent in her wave rider?  So it would seem.  Another mention and
it had tipped.  The world would live without them.  The bank was
replenished, and the ship was on budget for a flight.  They had no
where else they would rather be.  Solitude, for a spell.
