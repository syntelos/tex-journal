She walked up the avenue toward home, a prayer for consciousness, a
prayer for the salvation of life from the desolation of waste.  That
she had done the right thing with her time.  That she had not wasted
her breath on this rather some alternative unknown to her.

She looked at the sky.  Clouds dimly lit in the early evening.  She
wondered at their glory.  The sidewalk under her feet begged
forgiveness for covering the earth.
