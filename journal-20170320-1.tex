\input preamble

On balance the breath of me.  Myself.  Represented in us, in this
moment of me which would be us.  Therefore defended better than the
strongest fortress, projected better than the brightest star, and held
closer than I've ever held myself before.  It is the promise we've
expressed and developed and represented and \break maintained for ourselves.
It is beyond imagining, only to be realized in the breath remaining.

\bye
