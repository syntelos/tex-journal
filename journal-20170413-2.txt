The beauty within that knows better than the beauty without stands
before me in image of eye and practice of soul and more than that,
beyond my ability to proscribe.

I love her so I am but man, and need her of body and spirit such that
the love of our binding may have that physical expression of sexual
reproduction I am heir to.
