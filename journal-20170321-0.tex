\input preamble

The presentation comes from context, speaks from context, and arrives
in context.

The inner consciousness has a life of its own, it is an independent
center of consciousness.  The hundred billion neurons in the brain
operate in parallel over multiple centers of activity concurrently.

An inability to maintain the health of this system will actually hurt
other people.
