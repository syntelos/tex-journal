When expression falls away from science and person and has relevance
to others it is art.  In this space we reconcile ourselves with the
world, in our experience and our perception of the experience of
others.  When we need to reconcile with the world, to emote, to accept
or reject.  When we need to say that which has no other expression.
When the rivers of experience collide into a vein that must be let
free.
