\input preamble

Between the dry ridges that contained the Catawba Turnpike -- Broadway
between Greenville, Tennessee and Greenville, South Carolina -- at
Asheville was Foggy Bottom.  Over the western ridge was a drop down to
Lake Pisgah.  Under a cold morning sun in January the lake was frozen.
The Smokey Mountains covered in snow.  The chalet of government
overlooked the heights from the north by north east.  To its southern
exposure the sun rise, city and lake.  Beyond the lake over the far
horizon Mount Pisgah, Little Pisgah, and Cold Mountain.  All the earth
within the horizons, here.
