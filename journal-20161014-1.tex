\input preamble

The language here is ``selling tickets for admission of naval weapons
underwater between the lines''.  The statement of admission,
therefore, is that the candidate attacks $(X)$ with intent $(Y)$.

The action performed values $X$ to be the relationship in formation
between myself and Gwyneth, and $Y$ to be destruction.

Clearly the behavior on behalf of the candidate is bizarre,
inappropriate, and malicious.
