Making a contribution has a value that knows no monetary measure.  For
example, Einstein was not a rich man.  Not that I really have any
idea, but at least it seems obvious that he didn't have wealth in any
proportion to his contributions and the gazillions that resulted from
his efforts.

Money doesn't measure much, and this is central to a comprehension of
economic modeling.  It doesn't represent scarcity, and it doesn't
represent value.  

For example, it doesn't perform the allocation function once
hypothesized.  While it is the device we employ for the allocation of
scarce resoources, the obvious inefficiencies indicate a failure to
contain the problem.  That uncontained problem remains unsolved.
