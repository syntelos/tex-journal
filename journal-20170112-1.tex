\input preamble

Sophie saw Gerard walking up to Lucia's and thought this is it, this
is how it ends.  Her sense of humor a bit morbid for the observer
really only made sense in her head.  She began to worry that he would
see the senselessness of her personal expressions and believe her
confused or weird or maladjusted.  This fear of rejection rose within
and made her legs feel weak and wobbly.  Somehow all of this made her
smile.  She thought herself funny with a constant periodicity.  The
look on his face changed from something grave and serious to something
lighthearted and open as her mood changed.  Yep, this is it.  This is
the one.  It did not matter that their actions and reactions may have
been normal or abnormal or clich\'e or refined, there was no world
beyond herself and Gerard.  She stopped in front of him.  The door to
Lucia's was nearby, but no one was coming or going.  The world could
wait for her to kiss her man again.  With the following breath, right
on cue, his head moved toward her and she was gone.  He's mine.  I'm
kissing him.  I'm kissing him, kissing him, kissing him till the cows
come home.  Oh, je t'adore.  Je t'aime.  Je suis libre.
