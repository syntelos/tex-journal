\input preamble

Ernest and Juliet picked up the subway at Montford, and road past
Battery, Pritchard, and Broadway before the sled ride down to
Biltmore.  The mesh net held up while their backpacks were streaming
their day.  Like butterflies, or bumblebees, they would visit a
recording with the synchrony delivered.  

What they did, exactly, no one knew.  They had a million followers to
their mobile zoo who kept them well.  This symbiosys had produced many
effects.  So many productive and positive effects that they were,
thusly, elected to continue it.
