I do what I want,

I sing as I please,

Because I am me.

You are mine.

I am yours.

John, don't cry.

You will see.

All these things,

they are yours.

Don't you see.

It's divine.

Yes, one soul.

Then, another.

We are two.

Then one.

I am one.

You are you.

We are we.

Don't you see,

be divine.

This life is yours.

All is free.

In love.



That, over there.

It's a black hole.

You won't be free.

You won't be whole.

Live we three.

Live we four.

You will see it,

if you live it.

All is free.

All is love.

In love, you are free.
