ï»¿``Why should a child need to have a father?''

I don't want to say that on the air.  It's too pointy.  There's no
space for the discussion of anything in this world.  It's all hit and
run.

``In the perpetual sense, I think you mean.''

``Yes, of course.  Obviously in the biological sense there's the
mechanics of contribution.  But in the cultural space there's this
Reality that demands that a child have a father.''

``Otherwise the child is taken.''

``Yes, to be plain about it.  In one sense or another.''

``The subjective probability of success in the collective
consciousness falls.''

The exploitation of mass media had contributed to the massification of
the individual.  The individual as slave to society and its media.  It
had done so by an error of youth.  Decades of broadcasting driven by
materialized identities.  Broadcasting the socio-economic realization
of a socio-genetic actuality.
