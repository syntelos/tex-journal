﻿In the experience of existence is the processes of being, sensing,
finding, and knowing.  In love, an experience of existence, we know
the partner in being through sensing and finding.  In the experience
of partnership, we don’t have an objective process of identification
and characterization.  In partnership, there is a subjective, whole
spirit, process of being and sensing and finding and knowing which is
repeated hourly and daily.
