I don’t mind the force of it.  Disturbing or even disturbed.  I mind
the loss of it.  Time.  But it’s time lost to life, you see.


I’m not sure I understand.  The picture is plain enough.  But this
state is too bare to envelop that state.  I’m facing a certain waste,
and an alterior benefit.


To see the benefit is not simple.  It’s an art of life in art,
therefore it’s necessarily subtle.


Art is subtle, it illuminates the limits of awareness.  The actor with
the freedom to bring art into life and life into art is a creature
possessed of art, in a sense.


We many find expression valued.  It is the same, on a larger canvas,
with a larger palette.
