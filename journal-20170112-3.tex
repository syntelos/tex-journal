\input preamble

Sophie felt Gerard pull away and opened her eyes.  She could have had
more of that, but was happy to see him.  She saw in his eyes and found
a reflection of her feeling of a lapse in time.  It could have been
ten seconds or ten minutes, she felt like she had no idea and
discarded the notion of trying to focus on how much time had elapsed.
She smiled and when she did she noticed that he had smiled at the same
time.  She felt like she could feel his heart beating, and realized it
was her heart beating in her chest.  He took her hand and her focus
rotated from her heart to his hand in hers.  She realized she was
smiling when he spoke of eating.  She was starving.  She squeezed his
hand thinking, let's eat!  As they turned and walked through the door
she felt something she had never felt before.  Togetherness.  That
together they were more than two individuals.  Or that together they
were something different than two individuals.  She felt that she had
changed.
