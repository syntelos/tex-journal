\input preamble

He wears the mark of ignorance.  Of greed and power.  Old people
reaching for power are most pathetic.  Like lepers who are rapists.
The violence of the contradiction accelerates the violennce of the
thing beyond absurdity.  To me this becomes cartoon.  The resulting
velocity violates credibility as tragicly as a mouse attacking an
armored car at its tires.  The mouse looses in an instant best
forgotten as quickly as it happened.

But this particular sense of absurdity is important because in fact it
is a kind of power.  It has no merit, no credibility, and this is
dangerous.  It is the last gasp of formerly awkward teenagers who once
competed for reproductive rights of order and now compete for
relevance.  Their symbolic personhood has been elected to the place of
great power and they are glad of it.  They wear it on head with pride.

It is pride of ignorance, in fact, but pride nonetheless.
