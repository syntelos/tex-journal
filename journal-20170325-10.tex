\input preamble-png

Worlds apart in their experience of the world.

Fundamentally, there's an assumption of health.  

There's an assumption of good will that is very \break American.

And then there's the development of an \break understanding of the
difference, of health, of world.  \break  There's the separation of oneself
from interaction by learning, or by education, however it occurs.  The
separation of faith from na\"{\i}vet\'{e}.

They feel it in their bones.  That's what they're signing through work
and effort.
