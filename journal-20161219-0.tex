\input preamble

Following recent events, it's a shame that such an effort should be
made to produce such an impoverished result.

I can't advise you to do the right thing when it's extraordinary.  I
believe it's compelling.  I believe the example shown and commended
should be enough.  Stand up.  Do the right thing.  Is it really so
elusive?
