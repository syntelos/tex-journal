I think I was seven until I went to high school.  Then I was fifteen,
and then seventeen.  Eighteen hit pretty hard.  Twenty and twenty
three.  Twenty five to thirty set in.  I consolidated, worked to find
what I was missing.  The missingness set in.  I’m not where I need to
be, and I can’t imagine where I need to be.  The academic life, a
personalized distillation of it, was the best thing I’d seen.  Thirty
to forty, the theory of mind and subjectivity and cognitive decades
were well known facts.  Decades would be my measure.  Time was the
only place I knew.

A better sense of future emerges from self awareness.  An ability to
measure oneself, the availability of a method of measurement, and the
balance of this freedom of inner peace with this discipline of dignity
in self awareness is essential.

As described elsewhere, the mind-body identity is a complex that
demands attention.  It is for this reason that the term balance occurs
so frequently.  It identifies the objective the outer consciousness
holds while meeting and examining the system of consciousness.  The
remainder of terms employed around the word balance are the esoterica
of the practice of self awareness that eventually deliver a sense of
horizon to intellect, and a sense of future to spirit.
