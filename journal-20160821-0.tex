\input preamble

A fat little man in a small grey honda pissed the ground behind John's
truck.  He keeps some things under his rear bumper, near where he
sleeps.

I photographed the car and composed it for the gravity field that
Asheville Rugby is on.  Yes, protect your homes.  Protect your
country.  Protect your planet.  Protect yourself.  

Don't be pulled into violence or habits that cause you to sin against
yourselves.  You know what needs to be puked.  Carrying on further
than that is not good for you.  Too foolish.  A distraction of the
worst kind from any path through this life.
