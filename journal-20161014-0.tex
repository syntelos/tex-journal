\input preamble

In far too large aspect we live under the shadow of our oppressions.
Rome.  Britain.  Two popular examples among many large and small.
Down to households and food supplies.  Our women wear its ornament.
Our men deny the ornament.  Our sex is littered with injustice.  We
discard our own children and make murder and war at any opportunity.

\bye
