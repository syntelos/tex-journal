\input preamble

ï»¿It is the energy from within, felt as.  The inner consciousness never
sleeps.  It is the continuity on which intellect hangs its outer
consciousness.  The thoughts and efforts that give legs to becoming,
overcoming, walking.  The satisfaction that voids frustration.

Hung above concrete, strong as muscle.  An emotional continuity.
Life.  Existence.  Made peace with waking.
