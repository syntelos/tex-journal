\input preamble-png

The language of music combines temporal and aural discipline with the
sight of its notation.  The language of mathematics combines the
discipline of intellect and cognition, learning, with the sight of its
notation.  The language of cinema combines the discipline of being
with the technology of seeing.  

The reproducibility of understanding and comprehension and belief
known to art and science are distinct from the immediacy of learning,
and the practice of life.

The effort of creation is a state of being, consciousness, and
discipline of expression.

The practice of existence occurs within the primacy of the mind-body
identity.  Within the experience of existence, the mind-body identity,
unity, practices the arts of being and technology.

Being and technology are differentiated by reproducibility.  This is
art and science.
