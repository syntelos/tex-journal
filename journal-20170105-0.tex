\input preamble

``You could return to the university and accomplish either budget.''.
Sophie referred to Gerard's original career as researcher and
lecturer.  The symposium for special research had bumped his field
from the decadal survey, putting his lectures and budgets in the wash.
Optional.  Artificial orbital science was a special subjects
classification under the space research agency.  It had become a minor
activity during the reconstruction of the radio telescope on Battery
Hill, and would not become available again for more than a decade.  In
the meantime the best place for Gerard was lunar orbit.
