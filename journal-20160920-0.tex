\input preamble

{\it Gwyneth, you're in my head.}

{\it Not really, you understand.}

\noindent
\break

The jump off outer consciousness into inner consciousness left the
world except you in the dark.

\indent

{\it I caught you..} 

\noindent

Art at the speed of government was performed by subconscious,
primarily.  Gwyneth had been in my head for a long time.  I just
didn't know it was her.  The experience of her interpretations of my
work, murder.  A wonderful and inspiring down beat.  It only took a
year to refine and condense our languages and experiences and the art
we were modulating.

\indent

{\it Combining it all more murder.  The heard overwhelmed itself.
That's Dadaism 2.0.}

\noindent
\break

The journey through jungian stages and universal experience too rich
to postpone.  We would do both.  And the art and government thing.

Now it is written into the atmosphere of the planet, the global art of
change and being that will deliver humanity from the dark ages that
marked the turn of the century.
