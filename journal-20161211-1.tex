\input preamble

This morning I had my first conversation in which I verbally asserted
my paternity from within in the local frame.  {\it Step two.}  As you
might guess, reflection on that moment surprised me.  Not as any kind
of first, and not for the recent health gain in my outer
consciousness.  But for the breadth and depth of the expression.  I
picked up a scent and came out with, ``You don't have kids, do you''.
Imagine that!  From me!

Well, yes, indeed.  That's me.  Hello, me. {\tt (!)}

For the one who overcame the impossible, convincing an old logical
positivist to revist metaphysics in a big way.  One part discovery,
another part rediscovery, and another part reinvention -- but it
happened.  I never would have believed it possible -- obviously.  And
she wonders why I love her.  Pick up the finest of threads like an
expert in the art of his heart.  Show him that you know his heart like
his own.  Restore his faded faith in life.

Sure, why not, she says.  Easily done in this love.  The $\psi$ -- that
analog wave function -- is the thing.  Two hearts that beat as one.
There is no finer thing, no greater thing, no better thing for an
individual than the love that matches his own in the language of the
soul.

Oh, how I adore thee, analog music.
