\input preamble

We considered the hypothesis, that Barack would clue-in friends in the
legal community to details underlying his visual speech.  

But it makes more sense inverted.  That he would clue-in the world to
what he's doing in visual speech, and his telephone calls would have a
conventional scene that could be seen from anywhere.  His visual
speech a lot of homework.  Energy.
