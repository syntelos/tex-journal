\input preamble

What is it?  It's a secret!  

Secretly my phobia of writing had caught up with me.  I had imagined
strange things happening when I wrote.  Terrible forces moving
populations to and fro.  The politics of action and reaction and money
and power.

But there she was.  Standing there.  Waiting for me.  Mine.  How could
it be?  One like that.  Mine.  Unimaginable.

One like what?  I'm not like one.  I am one.  What am I?

Yes, that's what I don't really know.  You're an odorless, colorless
gas that I'm swimming in but can't place.  Drives me mad.  Perfection
to immersion without a clue.

So I'm perfection to immersion, then.

It's a start, but I'm not digging the reflections.  You make me dance
and sing like an idiot.  How's that?

I'm still digging perfection to immersion.
