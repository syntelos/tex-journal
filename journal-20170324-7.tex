The alignment of the individual requires the recognition of the
primacy of the self.  The alignment of society requires the
recognition of the primacy of the individual.  When we recognize and
inhabit these basic truths, we are healthy.

An effective expression for the health of an individual system of
consciousness is the (asexual) spectrum of centers of consciousness
described by a nondeterministic equation of the spiritual state of
being, as in the following.
$$\displaylines{ \psi = \alpha + \beta + \gamma, \cr \psi = \alpha \times \beta \times \gamma.}$$

This foundation for a {\it logical epistemology of existence}, or {\it
logical existentialism}, represents the knowledge of self awareness as
the knowing of the substance and significance of (the centers of)
consciousness.

We know when we are relatively healthy by the feelings of freedom and
justice, and perhaps happiness, joy, peace and love.

These simple truths are not unlike the simple truths known to physics.
We have established the knowing of knowledge, the sense of language,
the finding of comprehension, and the holding of belief in order that
we might recognize the primacy of the individual and (of)
consciousness.
