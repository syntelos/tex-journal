\input preamble

To her surprise, Gerard broke that first silence.  Never since has she
wanted for a word or gesture from him.  He simply told her that he had
fallen in love with her, in that moment, and that his feelings were
very strong.  She could rethink her proposal if this information did
not meet her needs.  She smiled in beams of glory and told him that
she would have to kiss him if he spoke another word.  He took a moment
for the emotional event to collapse into some form of consciousness
and said ``yes''.  She planted a big one on his lips and ran out into
the hallway, stopped to catch her breath, and walked away.  He
collapsed into his chair.  The next thought to enter his mind was the
place and time of their dinner date.  Tomorrow night.  It would be an
eternity.  He would be checking his messages twice as frequently in
case she sent him one.  She knew his name and address, by office, but
he didn't yet know her name.
