\input preamble

Dear Barack,

It is with a sense of obligation that I write to you this evening on
behalf of the North American Peoples and the citizens of the United
States.  In this sense, we write this letter together.

The issues of the North American Peoples are fundamental to the United
States in moral and legal terms.  The history of intolerance that
marks the events at Standing Rock is a grave one.  As a nation in
history we have cast shame on ourselves through our failures to honor
our moral and legal obligations to these people.  Presently we
continue to cast shame on ourselves by permitting that history of
dishonor to be repeated.

I have read that there are simple measures available via the Army
Corps of Engineers to disengage the pipeline project.  I have no doubt
that you could imagine an array of approaches to this problem, and
another array of approaches to this kind of problem.  These are beyond
me, but not you.  

While I constantly hesitate to inject our civic relationship into the
affairs of your office out of both respect and frustration with
politics, I also know that you demand it.  In the deeper sense of this
spirit, the avoidance of distraction from the peoples' obligations, I
write to invoke our shared sense of bettering the lives of our
children -- that we have obligations to perform within the available
exercise of power to impact the course of events in favor of living
and future generations.

With love and respect,

John Pritchard
