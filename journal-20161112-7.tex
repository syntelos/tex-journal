\input preamble

We learn a great deal in our situational reality.  We learn about the
phenomenon of synchronicity at the center of public life.  We mind
read, on a pen.  On a voice.  At a rhythm.  By imagination.

In this case, however, the price is too high.  The situation wears
black pajamas.  It has its values, those purposes served in walk
space.

G, J, B, and M and seven billion walking into the future together.
Picking up pages.  Closing doors.

\bye
