\input preamble

Who would speak of things that cause himself harm but one who loves
you.  Who would speak of things as to his own but one who loves you.

When you hate this person, you reveal an inability to accept this.
Which is not a problem until it turns to violence.  It's an old story,
violence against love.  Martin Luther King died for it.  Jesus Christ
died for it.  

I am not unfamiliar with violence against love.  

When I go to church I cry at the committment to love represented in
the gathering, the voices, the words and their meaning -- for the
significance and importance of love in society.  This is not so
different.  It is likewise an inability to handle the sight of such
beauty without a reaction.
