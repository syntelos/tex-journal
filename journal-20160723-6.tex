\input preamble

A potato is food, an ingredient, or a vegetable.  It may also be a
person.  A term of affection, or disaffection.  In the disaffected
view, looking down on people and problems affords a terribly expensive
view of the psychology of social issues which is crucial to the
understanding required in politics.

Seeing people in the incendiary brilliance of scientific coldness is a
bad habit as an amateur dive into alternative perspectives.  As a
person, seeing others as units of a calculus is terrible.  It ignores
that which one needs to breathe the air of social intercourse.

A discipline high enough to create new intellectual frameworks for
exploration and development would enter and exit such a perspective.
A day's work might occupy only a few hours in the look down
perspective, maintaining a human life in the normal air required for
living.

A deep dive into such a perspective shreds good habits of mind but
produces a lot of output.  A condensed experience that is insane,
actually, for the separation of the mind from the soul.  

That's what happens when we don't mind our fields and frames.  Someone
will get saddled with the catch up work, and that person might have
more work to do than is healthy for a person to do.  These people are
politicians and scientists.
