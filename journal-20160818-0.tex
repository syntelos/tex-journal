\input preamble

I believe you owe me some TeX.

Who are you?  

A caller from Idaho.  I own a silo, there.

A silo?

A lift? Grab? Got? Get? I believe they put this on us.

They did.

So we can put this on them.

You can.  

And you should.  That's what I've been getting at.  It's not the
immature but the mature that's the thing.  The parent.  Kids don't
know much about the parent.  What goes on.  How it works.  The
epistemological networks weighted for probabilities and expectations.
Culture.  Business.  Government.  Pretend.  Real.  Fake.

To their credit, they started off on the right foot.  A bit shock and
awe, but here's to faith in government, knowledge of gravity, sense of
opportunity, and assignations of committment.

And getting somme work done you insane hacker.  I let you through the
hell of epistemological privacy knowing that you'd get us over that
wall.
