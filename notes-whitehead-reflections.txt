Alfred North Whitehead: His Reflections on Man and Nature
Ruth Nanda Anshen, 1961, Harper and Brothers, NY, NY

Chap 1, Nature and Life

p10, problem statement (level of abstraction definition) "the status
     of life in nature", critique of positivism as a formulaic field
     of literature marching in succession

p11, positivistic myopia, lack of academic creativity, surplus of
     consistency, doctrine of simplicity, nature is no more than the
     union of mechanical routines described or to be described by
     science.  Descartes' separation of material substance and mental
     substance poisoned all subsequent philosophy.  

p12, ANW fusion doctrine "really real" things include physical nature
     and life, conception of life fused with nature, (eco life)
     "self-enjoyment" (smells like eco utility), derives "a certain
     immediate individuality" from this (utility), appropriation to
     self-enjoyment as prehension, immediate self enjoyment as
     occasion of experience, collective unity -- evolving universe --
     creative advance, (fixed level of abstraction is stable element
     of thought)

p13, occasion -- creativity -- intelligence, potential -- occasion --
     realization -- creativity, creativity -- realization --
     self-enjoyment, function of life in occasion of experience as
     fusion of potential with self-enjoyment, doctrine of creative
     advance

p14, aim as reduction of objective possibility space to inclusion
     within scope of actualization or realization, aim yields
     self-enjoyment (missing abstraction, imagining, projection, per
     se?).  "aim involves the entertainment of the ideal" "so as to be
     directive of the creative process", (emphasizing [enjoyment] as
     an attribute of process not result, ob in re [function]),
     (therefore sublimating a metaphysical analysis), senses
     irrelevant to the body [sight] and partly referent to the body
     [pain~]

p15, sight -- external presentation for entertainment or anxiety,
     sensory modes with prominent and recessive relevance to (mind and
     body), "information derived from sense-perception", "doctrines
     derived from Hume defective by reason of their neglect of bodily
     reference"

p16, that the laws of nature lack inherent necessity relates to the
     cause of elucidation of a logical metaphysics (existentialism) as
     the conscience of instrument that envelops the evolution of
     physics (natural science)

p17, the conscience of physics has been the doctrine of practical
     utility independent of a metaphysical conscience that would enable its
     own evolution

p18, independence of reason from instrument in doctrine of science,
     effective method with undefined philosophical underpinnings,
