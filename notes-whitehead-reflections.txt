Alfred North Whitehead: His Reflections on Man and Nature
Ruth Nanda Anshen, 1961, Harper and Brothers, NY, NY

Chap 1, Nature and Life

p10, problem statement (level of abstraction definition) "the status
     of life in nature", critique of positivism as a formulaic field
     of literature marching in succession

p11, positivistic myopia, lack of academic creativity, surplus of
     consistency, doctrine of simplicity, nature is no more than the
     union of mechanical routines described or to be described by
     science.  Descartes' separation of material substance and mental
     substance poisoned all subsequent philosophy.  

p12, ANW fusion doctrine "really real" things include physical nature
     and life, conception of life fused with nature, (eco life)
     "self-enjoyment" (smells like eco utility), derives "a certain
     immediate individuality" from this (utility), appropriation to
     self-enjoyment as prehension, immediate self enjoyment as
     occasion of experience, collective unity -- evolving universe --
     creative advance, (fixed level of abstraction is stable element
     of thought)

p13, occasion -- creativity -- intelligence, potential -- occasion --
     realization -- creativity, creativity -- realization --
     self-enjoyment, function of life in occasion of experience as
     fusion of potential with self-enjoyment, doctrine of creative
     advance

p14, aim as reduction of objective possibility space to inclusion
     within scope of actualization or realization, aim yields
     self-enjoyment (missing abstraction, imagining, projection, per
     se?).  "aim involves the entertainment of the ideal" "so as to be
     directive of the creative process"

p17, ANW has descended into a metaphysical realm with "there is no
     necessity" "exist as average convergence to deduction" ~~
