Alfred North Whitehead: His Reflections on Man and Nature
Ruth Nanda Anshen, 1961, Harper and Brothers, NY, NY

Chap 1, Nature and Life

p10, problem statement (level of abstraction definition) "the status
     of life in nature", critique of positivism as a formulaic field
     of literature marching in succession

p11, positivistic myopia, lack of academic creativity, surplus of
     consistency, doctrine of simplicity, nature is no more than the
     union of mechanical routines described or to be described by
     science.  Descartes' separation of material substance and mental
     substance poisoned all subsequent philosophy.  

p17, ANW has descended into a metaphysical realm with "there is no
     necessity" "exist as average convergence to deduction" ~~
