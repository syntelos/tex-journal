\input preamble

Oh, yes, she's funny.

What's she talking about?

The ethics of nonverbal assertion.  Endlessly complex.  Can lead to
misunderstanding.  Works while participants can get ver the hump.
Doesn't work outside familial relationships.  Work relationships can
be tough.  Sometimes there's a lot of pretend world in fake work
place.  Sometimes there's a work family at real work place.  Could be
problems at fake work place.

Parenting.  Did she say anythhing about my heroin/e query?  

She said you're nuts.

Ahem.

Alora.  She said it would be silly to believe that he was actually
chansing Plan B.  Rather, his quantum mechanical state expression was
encrypting his brain.

She said that?

No, he did.  And he also asserts that the quantum encryption link is
going deep.  As you well know.  It's kinda weird.  But functional.

You were serving heaping plates of fingerprints that said you were
nuts.  

Just expression all I can, everything at once.  Kinda crazy, that.

You got the picture.  It was all very proportional (square) to the
need to know (nose).
