\input preamble

A critical analysis of the views held by the Koch brothers is rendered
impossible by a lack of a fixed point of view on their part.  Their
media presents the critical reader with ``shifting sands'' that avoid
comparison to alternative points of view, undermining comparison and
criticism.

Many have issues with the existence or association of the underground
{\it Telephone Prison System} to the underground {\it Kochtopus} and
the secretive political campaign that the Koch brothers are known for.
Many find it hard to believe, or rather too disturbing to accept.

If true, then the shifting sands found in the Koch media outlets
present an information warfare interface to the world.  A random
collection of true and untrue and relevant and irrelevant that
entertains, engages, disturbs, and confuses.  

As described previously, this kind of media is capable of engaging and
capturing minds into a form of subliminal terror or torture.  This
point is esoteric and important: subtle and substantial.  That many
are neither believers nor disbelievers, but disturbed by the activity
there and here illuminates the issues at hand.

If some bizarre billionaires are exploiting human nature to such a
degree as to challenge the Constitution and Government of the United
States, then we need to learn how to handle and discuss it.  No?
