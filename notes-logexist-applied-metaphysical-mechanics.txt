The applied mechanics of logical existentialism need to describe
phenomena such as
* vanity, 
* pride, 
* the blessings of the holy spirit, 
* matrimonial bliss, 
* humility, 
* arrogance

As music resonates over consciousness independent of semantics known
or knowable (incompleteness) by the outer consciousness, the applied
mechanics of logical existentialism have limit at the aggregation
familiar to language.
