\input preamble

In 2016 we opened the conflict between heaven and hell.  Between sense
and lust.  We taught our children to read the languages of public
culture in these terms.  Relevance.  Import.  Substance.  We taught
our children to weigh significances.  To identify and characterize the
objects of sensory experience.  To qualify sensory inputs as external,
and to develop their relationship to the force within that balances
the external.
