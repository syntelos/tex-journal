While the world of the ``dark matter'' in the politics of the United
States remains in the murky domain of hearsay and inductive
communication, recent events have catapulted the subject to the front
pages of the planet's newpapers and broadcasts.  While the subject
remains in this relatively undocumented state, the responsibility to
provide contextual and textual support to the United States falls upon
us to uncover the story in this and our associated media.

The infamous audio recording of the Koch brothers' secretive political
fundraising raises an information issue.  While the unseen is unknown,
the release can be described as a terror device.  It delivers mystery,
thereby capturing the imagination in their ``Southern Strategy'' to
global power and money.  When the unseen is known, it constitutes an
evidentiary device in favor of their condemnation.

We have filtered the inductive communication networks into the
following critical detail.  The Koch brothers provided adult
prostitutes at those meetings in which participants were solicited for
billion dollar donations to their campaign for power over the
Government and Territory of the United States, and by implication the
planet.
