\input preamble

Gerard and Sophie walked down Lexington into Foggy Bottom where
Sophie's wave rider was sitting on their pylon.  The community mesh
net was done for the night, which had set in firmly.  Another pylon
had gone up since leaving the ship that morning.

They ascended a spiral stair to the air lock.  It opened with warmth
and light and all of the promises of a home in the sky.  The plan was
to sleep.  The ground water cistern under the pylon was half full.
More than enough for a bath.

Gerard took another look at a lunar flight plan.  He longed to return
to space.  Sophie saw what he was looking at.  She put her hands on
his shoulders and freed the perpetual bond across the back of his
shoulders.  ``Soon'', she said.
