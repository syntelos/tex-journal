\input preamble

You respond to the sublimated language in kind, in your own sublimated
language.  

Some basic terms should include ``I know what I'm saying.''  ``Do I
know what you're saying?''  ``Am I responding?''  ``Who am I speaking
to?''  ``I'm in school.''  ``I'm in the kitchen.''  ``I'm at home.''
``I'm at work.''
