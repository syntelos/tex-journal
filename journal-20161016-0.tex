\input preamble

My first kiss, of any kind not including my mother, was in first
grade.  Two girls blocked the doorway so I couldn't pass.  I don't
remember what they said.  I remember Josie.  She was the cool girl of
those early years.  She lived across the street and up the hill from
me.

I don't remember well, but I think I kissed both of them on their
foreheads, and they reacted like I'd stepped on their toes.  They let
me pass by at least.  I walked away wondering what happened.

Story of my life.

OK. OK. OK.  It's a lot more conscious now.  But in some aspects there
can be similar {\it accelerations} of wonder and mystery that act on
{\it masses} of awareness and concern to produce {\it forces} that
keep us guessing {\it what just happened}.

So as adults we define things.  We sign and acknowledge and recognize
the benefits of the seeing in our lives.  The benefits of sharing
these moments, the crazy ones that create relationships.  The laugh
that bows the head in mystery at the limits of consciousness.  Our
captivated little brains bouncing off each other at the limit of
intellect and discipline and art to express a moment.
