This distance has me in a strange place.  A peculiar vulnerability,
having my heart in public, dealing with other peoples’ problems,
employing rouge and ruse to walk our (my) situation through the time
of changes personal and impersonal, private and public.  It’s
disconcerting and on-putting and off-putting, comfort and discomfort,
familiar and unfamiliar.

So phi, φ, love, λ, strange love, φλ.  

The disposable intellect balancing over feet as hands that grasp the
matters of art and life to integrate art and life and awareness with
force and energy and strength of character.  The awareness of
character necessary to another art of life, a pursuit of life, this
life.  A sense of my invariants, my character, my strengths and
capacities and wishes and aspirations and ambitions.
