Wells {\it et al.} (1981) anticipated the need to specify the
physical, or world, coordinates to be attached to each pixel of an
N-dimensional image.  By world coordinates, we mean coordinates that
serve to locate a measurement in some multidimensional parameter
space.  They include, for example, a measurable quantity such as the
frequency or wavelength associated with each point in a spectrum {\it
or, more abstractly}, the longitude and latitude in a conventional
spherical coordinate system which define a direction in space.  World
coordinates may also include enumerations such as ``Stokes
parameters'', which do not form an image axis in the normal sense
since interpolation along such axes is not meaningful.
