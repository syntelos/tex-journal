\input preamble

The experiment, it's a lie to call it that, was a success.  Well, perhaps not
so much a lie as getting it straight.  Object, subject and observer.  It proved that
the subject was indeed insane, as previously feared.  And for this reason it was
a success.  It was important to know whether the subject was delusional or actually
at a loss for his senses.  The experiment proved that the subject was both delusional
and at a loss for his senses.  As expected.  No news, there.
