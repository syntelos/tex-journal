What's that? 

A salad spinner?

What's a salad spinner?

A Caesar Code.  A substitution code.  Render until Caesar that which
does not fit.

For example, ``I love avocados'' becomes ``I love John''.

What if you want to say to me, ``I love avocados''. 

Then I could say, ``I write avocados''.

Hm.  Clever.
