\input preamble

The imposition or enforcement of a debtors' prison by recruiters and
others subverts the principles espoused in the Bill of Rights.  The
data contained in a credit report is not a reliable indicator of
responsibility toward rental or house payments or productivity at work
until we have a sociological problem with our credit reports.
