\input preamble

The domain of the subconscious is spiritual for the individual.  Its
energies cannot be described so simply as psychological forces.  This
term relates to a lot of good and useful work, but the domain within
oneself can be healthy enough that the basic tools of self government
fail to capture more subtle issues.  The spiritual energy within
stumbles over an electrodynamic metaphor, but not the vague concepts
afforded by quantum mechanics.  It's very easy to conclude that the
experience of a quantum mechanical physicality is quantum mechanical
in character.

Interactions within the self are forceful and subtle.  I've learned
how to interact with the sense of these energies indirectly, but not
directly.  An initial step.
