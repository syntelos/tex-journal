\input preamble

Someone told them it was that way, and they forgot it was a story they
heard.  They thought it was true.  That the others depend on this or
that illusion of conclusion, otherwise they'll come and there'll be a
fight.  And if you loose that fight, they'll rape your girl and kill
your children, then wait on you to kill yourself.  

That's it, that's the delusion.  Fight or die.  Fight or die.  Fight
or die.  Whatever dream is in your head ends now.  Fight or die.
Fight or die.  Fight or die.  I need you.  I need to fight or die with
someone who will believe me.  I need someone to believe me.  I need
someone to die with me.

A cricket hides in a corner of the basement, near the door, rubbing
his legs.  He eats the little bugs when they come.  It's a simple
life.  He grows larger each time I notice him.
