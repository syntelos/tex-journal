\input preamble

In our culture there is a subliminal male experience of mutual
destruction.  It is a negative form of bonding that impacts adult
females within the rubric ``rape culture''.  The scent of it on the
female population is distinct.  It is mistrust.  In the practice of
general social intercourse it may be represented by the terms ``man''
and ``woman''.  The disservice is self evident.
