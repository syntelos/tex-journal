\input preamble

We hold over

$$
 \phi\alpha = \zeta \times \alpha
$$

a finitude, such that it realizes a truth in

$$
 \phi\alpha = \nu \times \alpha
$$

an infinitude.  The spiritual existence of being that transcends
knowing and seeing to surrender to space and time becomes

$$
 \psi = \alpha \times \gamma.
$$

In this surrendering one walks forward in faith until seeing and
knowing make clear the objective within being.

This is the being that transcends or contains art and science and self
in the opening of mind, outer consciousness, to the balance with inner
consciousness.

While in another, $\beta$, such that

$$
 \psi = \alpha + \beta + \gamma
$$

in the absence of separation.

Therefore being is nondeterministic

$$\psi = \alpha \times \beta \times \gamma$$
$$\psi = \alpha + \beta + \gamma$$

accordingly.
