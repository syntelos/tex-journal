\input preamble

It's no mystery that a mental deficient, patient Donald, has been
elected to a high office in a wave of collective delusion.  He has
been characterized as a sociopath.  He defends himself with endless
hysteria.  As a political figure of substantial presence, the effect
of the persona is to promote the delusion that elected him.

The world will sort patient Donald and the delusional that worship at
the alter of hysteria.  It is our r\^{o}le to put that in its place,
to improve our selves without distraction, and to ensure a future for
our children despite the self destruction offered by the deficiencies
of our political process.

It is no more than a man, and men, who lack every humility in the face
of their delusion.  The highly visible absence of presence of mind is
evident in an inability to contain the delusion.
