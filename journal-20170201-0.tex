The error known as {\it fundamentalism} is myopia.  

For the individual {\it homo sapien} as $\psi = \alpha + \beta
+ \gamma$, where $\alpha \equiv I$, $\beta \equiv you$, and
$\gamma \equiv he$, or $\alpha \equiv self$, $\beta \equiv us$, and
$\gamma \equiv them$, the hierarchy of needs is represented as
$\alpha \gg \beta$ and $\beta \gg \gamma$.  Within $\alpha$ is the
subjective self and the objective intellect.  Both the subjective
inner consciousness and the objective outer consciousness are gifts of
life that are critical to a healthy individual as represented in
$\phi\psi \gg \phi\gamma$.  In $\phi\psi$ we think of balancing
subjective and objective, inner and outer consciousness as maximizing
the health of the individual in $\psi$.  The frame of analysis,
$\phi$, is critical to the representation of $\psi$.

The error of the fundamentalist is selfishness.  A false belief that
imbalance is superior to balance.  A false belief that $\psi$ is
static or object or other than itself.
