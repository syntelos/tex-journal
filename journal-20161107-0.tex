\input preamble

A basement within the external consciousness, intellect and mind, may
lie below as in a well.  Memories less than, unsorted.

The social memory in the play back request to sort and store.
Perchance to forget.

Below is self.  Quartz or diamond bedrock of self, the inner
consciousness.

From another perspective, in another hour, on another planet, the
inner self is a tear or smile.
