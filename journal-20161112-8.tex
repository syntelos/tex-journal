\input preamble

He, husband, was staring into the empty void in his mind.  His
thoughts weighed on his shoulders.  His step bent at his knee.  His
arm strained.  His chest in pain.  His ground in disarray.

Somehow this situation would have to be resolved.  The imbalance
removed.  The mind in walk.  The heart in talk.  Speak that I may
recognize thee.  She spoke.  Whispered.  He heard.  And responded.  A
love affair.  Subject to appearances?  No more than pleases us.  We
speak in the silence of our lives, thus lived.  Within the aduality of
human experience.  Life.  This life.  Imperfect.  Formed and governed
as described.  Because.  Love.
