{\section Metaphysical reference frame system}

\bigskip

Let us define an {\it intensive frame} as a dictionary that defines
terms of observation and representation.  And, an {\it extensive
frame} as a model of terms of observation.

The {\it metaphysical reference frame system} has been extablished in
[2021/06/17 Journal 0] and is developed, here, to encompass variation
of form.  The {\it intensive} or {\it intrinsic} form is a basic and
fundamental recognition of the psycho -- physiological process of
recognition, objectification, and association that is common to
observation and reflected in language, literature, and logic.

The {\it intensive} or {\it intrinsic} frame represents the central
and critical metaphysical activity of recognition and association.
$$
 \phi \, [ \, \omega \rightarrow_{\rho} o ]
$$

The {\it extensive} or {\it extrinsic} frame represents abstraction
including learning and language.  A class of relations is established
with conception inclusive of {\it validation by replication}, which is
familiar to the intrinsic frame and founding of a theory of error for
the extrinsic frame.  
$$
 \phi \, [ \, \omega \rightarrow_{\rho} \mu + \varepsilon ]
$$
