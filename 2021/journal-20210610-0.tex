{\section Political crime}

\bigskip

When Gina Haspel was Director of Central Intelligence she made a
spectacular display at Auburn University which evoked self
preservation and the defense of one's own.  Her story is well known:
she destroyed evidence of wrong doing by her colleagues.  Her display
might recommend the social clothing of compassion and sympathy.  In
veracity of actuality it would seem to be more likely that her display
at Auburn was political.  Perhaps the appearance of a raising of the
dead in a contest of departmental integrity.  Perhaps in the contest
for the logical integrity of our national government.

This interpretation recommends to the observer a review of sympathies.
In [Political class conflict 2021/06/08 Journal 0] the effects of
political criminality in government are reviewed in terms of violent
crime.  In [Metaphysical review 2021/06/03 Journal 0] the cause of
political criminality in government is reviewed in terms of history.

The sympathies that accept or replicate political crime demand review.
It is typically a failure to conceive of political crime.  To
recognize that the exploitation of government in self service by
political class conflict is a crime, and the habituation is criminal.
