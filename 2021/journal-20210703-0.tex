{\section Recognizing criminality}

\bigskip

The political criminal depends upon high profile illusion.  First
priority is the maintenance of the credibility, stature, and
superiority that is the method and means of distraction from the
desperation and dependence of crime.  The tactics of division serve
the strategy of division.  Political division occurs naturally by
certitude of ineptitude.  People get upset when they are convinced of
an error.  Until the error is resolved, it is a sublimated
disturbance.  The cultivation of frustration occurs as a matter of
course in a sociopathological pursuit.

A political career is an easy choice for a committed sociopath.
Everything that happens is the ``bread and butter'' of exploitation.

Likewise, the politicisation of government is a crime.  For example,
it is criminal for a law enforcement officer to perform with a
political intent.  When a law enforcement officer is standing on a
political purpose, that person is found engaged in a criminal act.
Intent is self evident.
