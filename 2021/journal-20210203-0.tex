{\section A logical psychology of sentience}

\body

A cognitive process is one of either experiential or experimental
relative to the physical horizon.  The immediate physical horizons of
mortality are perceptible in a metaphysical actualism, and intangible
in a metaphysical realism.  The projection of realism is a
manifestation of self realization.  The knowledge of actualism is a
history of self actualisation.
