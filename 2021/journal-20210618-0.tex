{\section Global social reference frame}

\bigskip

The {\it global social reference frame} ($\sigma\phi\tau$) is the
planetary macrocosm of population ($\pi$), law ($\lambda$), government
($\gamma$), economy ($\rho$), and time ($\tau$). [2021/06/03 1,

$$
 \sigma_{\phi} = \pi_{\phi} + \lambda_{\phi} + \gamma_{\phi} + \rho_{\phi} + \tau_{\phi}
$$
The effect of government is the product of purpose or accident.  The
population has a state of being.  Each nation is a collection of
characters.  The effect of each has a character of peace or violence.

Our sustenance and development is represented by the sovereignty of
humanity.  Unfortunately, the sovereignty of humanity is in a state of
flux.  It is degraded by violence and opacity, and reinforced by peace
and transparency.  It should be universally understood that standing
together in solidarity we have our sustenance and development in the
sovereignty of humanity.  And divided we fall.  To greed,
exploitation, ignorance, and fear.  The simple error of enormous
tragedy.  The error of inhumanity.
