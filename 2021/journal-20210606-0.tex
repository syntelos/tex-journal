{\section Social government}

\bigskip

In the {\it global social reference frame} or {\it physical society},
$$
 \sigma_{\phi} = \pi_{\phi} + \lambda_{\phi} + \gamma_{\phi} + \rho_{\phi} + \tau_{\phi} ,
$$
the effective performance of government is inhibited when a decision
choice selection is irrational.  

The issue arrives to awareness in time.

And a rational society values correction in that the majority are not
self destructive.
