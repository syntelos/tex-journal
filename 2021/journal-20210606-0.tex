\bigskip

In the {\it global social reference frame} or {\it physical society},
$$
 \sigma_{\phi} = \pi_{\phi} + \lambda_{\phi} + \gamma_{\phi} + \rho_{\phi} + \tau_{\phi} ,
$$
the effective performance of government is inhibited by psychological
issues when a binary decision choice is rational (socially positive)
or irrational (socially negative).  The performance of an irrational
choice is a behavioral error attributed to a psychological issue.
