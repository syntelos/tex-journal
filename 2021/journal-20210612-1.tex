{\section Metaphysical review}

From Gina Haspel [2021/06/10 0] to President Biden [2021/06/03 0]
[2021/06/04 1] [2021/06/08 0], Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merckel
[G7], we can see Vladimir Putin once again perform the crimes of
induction to division, intimidation, extortion, subjugation, and
exploitation.

A very large number of people can sense those suggestions.  Russian
media is not subtle.  He is a ``killer'', in private and in public.
However, the ``kill'' should be a point in favor of awareness.  That
the disinformation is political and the intent is culpable.  That the
issues of politics include challenges to the sovereignty of humanity
by the pursuits of criminal exploitation.

The rights to social independence and economic interdependence are
among the innumerable human rights of pacific society.  We criminalize
the destruction of self, other, and group in the right to self
preservation and development.

Vladimir Putin seeks to obviate the education demanded of humanity,
and thereby to exploit.  Many others do as well.  And it has become
common to do so.  It is criminal to do so.
