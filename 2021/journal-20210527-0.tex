{\section Growing pangs in the post trump world}

\bigskip

If we can abuse that ``post trump world'' thing a bit, we may find
greater breadth and depth than the tragic absurdity that was Narco --
Avaro -- Sadism (NAS) in the Whitehouse.  NAS in the worlds of the
unwilling and insecure is the habituation to the darkness of error and
fear.
