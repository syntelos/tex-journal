{\section Metaphysical review}

\bigskip

Confronting our humanity we have the mysteries of physicality and
metaphysicality [Physical cognitivism, 2021/06/02] and the present
working condition of political economy.

In our global political history we have grave concerns.  The British
Monarchy is a heart of darkness beyond the understanding of many, but
having universal impact.  The meaning of the term {\it capitalism} in
the context of global historical actuality has greater significance at
a monarch's power over capital than a proletarian accumulation of
wealth ({\it socialism}).

The terrible tragedy of WTC 2001/09/11 has become a terrible terror.
Perhaps a manifestation of sexual insecurity, the terror produced by
the war on terror is domestic.  There is a DHS bloc that reigns junk
to effect a perversion of history by a malignment of lives.  It is
destruction from self destruction.  Obviously, DHS needs to be
devolved and defunded to eliminate a producer and consumer of
political class conflict, and a collaborator to exploit government in
self service.

When President Biden mentioned democracy and jobs yesterday, these are
plainly the issues he refers to.
