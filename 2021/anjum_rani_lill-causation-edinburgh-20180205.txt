* Looking into metaphysical epistemology from the perspective of causality reveals critical theory.

* [16:18/56:47]

  "So, if we really want to compare methods and make a hierarchy, we
  should first find out what causation is.  So I think in this way,
  epistemology is not completely independent from ontology."

** Ontology: a set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that shows their properties and the relations between them.

** Epistemology: the theory of knowledge, especially with regard to its methods, validity, and scope.

* Resolving "conflict of result" to "perspective" or "method"
** (Causation in medicine is virtually purely physical)
** [18:20] "How we practice science"

* [18:45] "Metaphysics really matters"
