{\section Individual metaphysical reference frame}

\bigskip

When we first open the concept $\alpha\phi\lambda$ [Individual
metaphysical reference frame 2021/06/09 Journal 0] we might survey the
products of realism, the world of reality.  We might examine the
prevalence of violence.  From self to national defense, we seem to
integrate violence into anything and everything as if it were
pragmatic to do so.  We might review the state of individual moral
development.  Issues of government are often mired in self actuality.
The incompleteness of comprehension, the insustainability of
immorality.

It does not follow that violence is pragmatic.  Violence is not
rational.  A pragmatic and rational defense of self occurs by the
maintenance of boundaries and distances.  The prevalence of violence
is irrational.  For example, political criminality in government
[Political class conflict 2021/06/08 Journal 0].

Many of the horizons open by communication are vital.  Many of the
errors of conception and comprehension are critical.  Some are
unprepared.  Some are careless.  Some are reckless.  This aspect of
the common social realism is a cause for caution in the adoption of
social reality {\it in lieu} of the observation of actuality.
