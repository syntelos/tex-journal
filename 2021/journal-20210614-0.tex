{\title Political narcissism}

The suggestion of her behavior, aside from the reign of junk, is that
she is the superior criminal.  Certainly I missed it.  That she is a
criminal.

A first estimation of such behavior is fear.  Another is self
destruction.  It follows from society and law, from the
criminalization of self destruction.  However, the criminal expects
the process of understanding to perform as his trap.  The content is
inane.  The self destruction is most practical.

By way of understanding is a conceit of propriety.  The violation of
the social independence of the individual is a conceit of propriety.
This propriety is found in sociopathology.  Perhaps rather ``anti --
propriety''.  The individual lacking the intimacy of social membership
in the breadth and depth of other as same, group as many other, and
world as all others.  The individual who has never had the courage to
place self in society and world.  The individual who continuously
fails at errors of self awareness.

That self destruction is performed by crime.  Each violation, implicit
or explicit, of humanity is self destructive.  Each violation of human
rights is a crime, and the habituation is criminal.
