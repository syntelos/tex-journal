{\bf EFFECT} {\bf CULPABILITY} {\bf INTENT} {\bf LIABILITY}

A fundamental of economic analysis is {\it effect}.  The government is
{\it established} on behalf of the {\it sovereign} to manage the {\it
public good}.  The government has been {\it qualified} by an {\it
immunity} that affords the executive practice of law required of it on
behalf of the sovereign in order to manage the public good.

An {\bf effect} contrary to the public benefit (of the sovereign {\it
en masse}) is a culpability qualified by {\bf intent}.  When intent is
culpable, the government is {\bf liable}.

In the case we are familiar with, today, the government is well known
to be causal to effect a public bad.  And as well, the government
stands intent to cause that effect.

In particular, the observation of the so called ``needles'' of effect
that might escape notice by disassembly, deception, and denial.  An
invisibility of disassembly and unimaginability is presumed with the
observation of criminal intent.  The actors on record have
demonstrated the performance of harassment and intimidation that
establishes a criminal intent.  The case is labelled {\tt LOVEINT} for
convenience, and spans available jurisdictions.

In this case the government stands liable to enormous liability.  If
we circumscribe inclusion to the immediate instances of effect, we
know there to be unknown many million members in that group.
