{\section A logical psychology of development}

\body

Every individual has a lifetime of metaphysical development.  When one
ignores one self as a metaphysical consciousness in a process of
continuous evolution, one may be said to be removed from one's path of
development.

Efforts of development are the exercises of the metaphysical
consciousness.  Reading and writing in any language and medium.  Yoga,
meditation, and continuous meditation as a perpetual balancing of
reflection, action, and interaction.  Listening and speaking.
Performance and sport.
