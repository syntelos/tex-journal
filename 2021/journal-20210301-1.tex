{\section Experiential sexuality}

\body

An existential sexuality begins with the identification and
characterization of a relevant epistemological universe.  However, an
experiential sexuality may begin with simple intimacy.  And opening
that subject may begin with touch.

It is very easy to think about and to discuss touching without
entering into a sexual consciousness, or even a hyper- sexualized
intellect.  It should be intuitive that touch affords enormous
expression that is generally relevant to, and independent of, sexual
intercourse.

For example, a handshake deals in ego like voice.  Both touch and
voice express condition.  And condition has an obvious import to
sexual intercourse.
