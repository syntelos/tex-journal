{\section Metaphysical reference frame system}

\bigskip

Seeing a bluebird toss some leaves as he hunts his dinner, I'm
reminded of the analytical exercise found in the observance of the
displacement of those few leaves.  In $\alpha\phi\lambda$ we find the
familiar sympathy for dining.  In $\alpha\phi\tau$ we thank eternity
for the innumerable splendors of bluebirds.  And in $\sigma\phi\tau$
we caution ourselves against the annihilation of environment and,
thereby, of life.
$$
 \alpha_{\phi} = \kappa_{\phi} + \psi_{\phi} + \delta_{\phi} + \lambda_{\phi} 
$$
The {\it individual metaphysical reference frame}
($\alpha\phi\lambda$) is microscopic: the familiar individual is
sentient ($\kappa$), conscious ($\psi$), mortal ($\delta$), and
linguistic ($\lambda$).  [2021/06/09 0 and 1, 2021/06/12 0]
$$
 \alpha_{\phi} = \kappa_{\phi} + \psi_{\phi} + \delta_{\phi} + \lambda_{\phi} + \tau_{\phi}
$$
The {\it individual of humanity millenia} ($\alpha\phi\tau$) is a
temporal macroscope on the metaphysical individual in sentience
($\kappa$), consciousness ($\psi$), mortality ($\delta$), language
($\lambda$), and time ($\tau$).  [2021/06/12 0]
$$
 \sigma_{\phi} = \pi_{\phi} + \lambda_{\phi} + \gamma_{\phi} + \rho_{\phi} + \tau_{\phi}
$$
The {\it global social reference frame} ($\sigma\phi\tau$) is
macroscopic: population ($\pi$), law ($\lambda$), government
($\gamma$), economy ($\rho$), and time ($\tau$). [2021/06/03 1,
