{\section Individual metaphysical reference frame}

\bigskip

Including the perspective from within, from self outward, and the
perspective from without, from other inward,
$$
 \alpha_{\phi} = \kappa_{\phi} + \psi_{\phi} + \delta_{\phi} + \lambda_{\phi}
$$
the spiritual human being ($\alpha$) is seen in a metaphysical frame
of reference including the cognito -- experiential ($\kappa$), the
psycho -- moral ($\psi$), the physio -- temporal ($\delta$), and the
open metaphysical horizons due to language ($\lambda$).

In the metaphysical reference frame system this frame is
$\alpha\phi\lambda$.  It is proposed as available to envelope the
metaphysical individual.  The immediate experience, the historical
development of experience, and the general metaphysical experience are
representative of the metaphysical person.

The $\alpha\phi\lambda$ is available to the depths of being and the
breadths of physicality.
