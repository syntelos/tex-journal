{\section Metaphysical review}

\bigskip

In the President's fingerprints we have worlds upon worlds of issues.
The ``build back better'' has become B3W, ``build back better world''.
Our various efforts to develop self, same, group, and world have had
innumerable effects.  That inertia has absorbed a tremendous
acceleration with the presence of awareness and reason.

The {\tt LOVEINT} fiasco continues with {\it law enforcement} noses in
law books, or not.  (``Polluter Page'', Senator Whitehouse).

The {\tt SNOWDEN} component includes the concept of {\it personal
intelligence products} as the moral fortitude to find voice with
intelligence.  (``Very carefully.'', General Nakasone).

A {\tt JUSTICE} component follows or shares these isssues of law and
society, most recently best illustrated by absurdity of the case of
E. Jean Carroll: ``The DOJ is doing everything to clean up Trump's
corruption, except dropping his defense.''.

The {\tt POWER} aspect of U.S. AID is presently engaged by President
Macron, as well.  Perhaps, ``How much of world wide violence is
political noise?''.  (And how much is unreasonable historical
attachment?).  And how much of that is the political disinformation of
manipulation?
