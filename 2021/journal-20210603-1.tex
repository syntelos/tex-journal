{\section Physical socialism}

\bigskip

The term {\it physical socialism} is intended to represent the
recognition of power ($\pi$) (work ($\rho$) over time ($\tau$))
$$
 \pi = \rho / \tau
$$
in society and economy.  In the physical reference frame, social
issues of law ($\lambda$), government ($\gamma$), and economy ($\rho$)
have a temporal logic of development and evolution.
$$
 \sigma = \lambda + \gamma + \rho + \tau
$$
Therefore population ($\pi$) is in that frame.
$$
 \sigma = \pi + \lambda + \gamma + \rho + \tau
$$
That is the physical reference frame of society as familiar to
politics.

In this frame, {\it physical socialism} contrasts to {\it physical
capitalism} as the conception of power is sovereign or subjugated
