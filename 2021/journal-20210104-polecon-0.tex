{\bf A promised land}

The United States as empire would be emperiled by the blood of
inception.  The United States as republic has been promised to a
sovereignty of humanity.  That proposition is a promise of conception
in awareness.  An exemplar of the promise of a planet in peace,
dignity, health, and wellbeing.  Not exceptionalism but necessity.

The United States as empire is {\it nigger territorialism}.  Each
individual constrained and restrained, in a condition as violent and
undignified as {\it ``fight or flight''}, marking territory of
subsistence.

It is illusions of power as available to a {\it paranoid delusional}
state of being that inhabit the psychologies of {\it
hyper-rationality} and {\it hyper-objectification} responsible for
that elusive American imperialism.
