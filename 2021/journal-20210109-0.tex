{\bf a graduate seminar in humanity}

\bigskip

We have a small group dedicated to the development and sustenance of
our humanity in the {\it Asheville Survival Program}.  My initial
recognition is of the many possible meanings of that title.  A second
recognition was {\it Speghetti School: Kartoum Karzai} as
intermediate.  My reflections on the {\it ASP} group derive from my
experience and processes, and are my own.  The latest being {\it a
graduate seminar in humanity}.

In this concept we practice exercises of social independence including
the distinctions of communication and relationship.  We may
communicate.  We may communicate emotionally.  While we maintain
explicit the distinctions of relationship.
