{\title Political narcissism}

{\section Delusional fantasy}

\bigskip

It should be well known that {\it delusions of grandeur} is common to
any national politics.  At the concentration of our power we exercise,
discuss, describe, and study.  It is rational and it is necessary to
do so in the service of awareness and reason.  However, the subject
induces hallucination in the unprepared.  In those for whom individual
and social relationship concepts are not well established, understood,
and developed, the property of relationship or society is ``free as in
beer''.  A subscription to that concept is not unlike believing that
one is God or King.  Such a belief induces delusion, which is referred
to as {\it delusions of grandeur}.
