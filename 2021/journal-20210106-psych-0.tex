{\bf a logical psychological observatory}

\bigskip

The observation of awareness {\it versus} resistence to awareness or
relatively hostile anti-awareness is an observation of wellbeing {\it
versus} illbeing.  The differentiation of self and other is taught to
children entering social situations as a developmental necessity.

The awareness of self has developed with a sense of social membership.
That relationships serve a mutual benefit.  That presence,
communication, interaction, or contact are not relationship
initiators.  That other is like self.  That person is the presence of
self.

The anti-awareness is camouflage to the absence of open horizons of
communication.  Relatively healthy avoidance of the unknown is
cautious conversation.  Hostility and aggression mask a virtual
conversational disability.  An issue of literacy, or the awareness of
inawareness or anti-awareness.
