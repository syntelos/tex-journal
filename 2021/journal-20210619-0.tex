{\section Horizons and frontiers of humanity}

\bigskip

The fear of inhumanity is familiar and common to many people.
Presence is dominated by issues of insecurity.  Interactions are
dominated by issues of violence.  These situations arise from, and are
perpetuated by metaphysical poverty.

The error of inhumanity is irrational.  By behaving poorly one
demonstrates inferiority.  That conflict has priority over
interaction.  Possible future relationships are discarded.  Individual
metaphysical power is annihilated.

There are many humanist traditions that guide children and adults away
from or out of self destruction.  Theological, familial, social, and
educational traditions emphasize metaphysical wealth and wellbeing.
Social independence.  Economic interdependence.  Humor.  Kindness.
Generosity.

Perhaps it is generosity of spirit that recommends abandoning sources
and causes of illbeing.  Metaphysical wealth is available at the cost
of abandoning attachment to metaphysical poverty.
