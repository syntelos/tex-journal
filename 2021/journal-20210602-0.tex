{\section Physical cognitivism}

\bigskip

Physical cognitivism inquires about the difference between
neurological and alternative epistemologies.  The neurology reuses
neurons within neural networks in processes of adaptation and adoption
to implicitly model experience, producing abstraction effects.

In this physical frame of reference, nihilism might be seen to assert
an effectualism in contradistinction to an abstractionism.  The effect
is to assert that words ({\it e.g.} cat, gracine, monkey) are harmful.

That assertion has no relation to the elementary social issues derived
from hyper -- objectification.  For example, ``Don't call him a
junkie, it's beneath you.''.  (``Deal in awareness.'').

That assertion deals in conception as found in metaphysics for example
in History, where victors are awarded benefits that obscure history.

Existentialism and positivism assert a need for epistemological
familiarity, while the espoused perspective on nihilism would assert
annihilation.  Of language.  And by extension of population.

The effectualism that contradicts abstractionism can stop at physical
cognitivism, or contemplate assignment to a nihsistential crisis of
objectification and destruction.
