{\title Logical existentialism}

{\section Population \& environment}

\bigskip

In the {\it global social reference frame},
$$
 \sigma_{\phi} = \pi_{\phi} + \lambda_{\phi} + \gamma_{\phi} + \rho_{\phi} + \tau_{\phi} ,
$$
the vitality of a physical population ($\pi$) is entirely dependent
upon the natural environment, from air and water to magnetic field.

Excluding environment is an emphasis to the physicality and
metaphysicality of the population.  To encourage seeing worlds upon
worlds of observation through that symbolic logical expression.

This metaphysical reference frame is $\sigma\phi\tau$.  It is
macroscopic: population ($\pi$), law ($\lambda$), government
($\gamma$), economy ($\rho$), and time ($\tau$).  Like any reference
frame its role is gyroscopic: to orient a pursuit of comprehension.

When we employ $\sigma\phi\tau$ we might be shocked to recognize the
world in light of veracity of actuality, aside from conventions of
reality.  To do so we seek information, experience, and understanding
to develop stages of comprehension.  We accept actuality as
independent of the social wisdom of reality.  We suspend realism and
subscribe to actualism.
