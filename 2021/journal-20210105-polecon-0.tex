{\bf a logical psychology of society}

A perceptual field of others is populated with variations on a theme
of humanity punctuated by variations on a theme of inhumanity.  The
sanity and inanity of morality and depravity are the hills and valleys
of sense and sensibility.  The perceptual field assembled is a
metaphysical field.  A social field of awareness.

From a social field of awareness we derive innumerable
differentiations of organic security, linguistic intellect, and
ethereal esoterica.  In the visual accumulation of available
information we find subtleties of being when we are not interrupted by
inanity.  We communicate in substance of significance and fail to
communicate in nonsense of no significance.

The effective field of awareness is made abstract by discontinuity.
However, that discontinuity is reflected in the larger {\it
macrocosmae} of society.  Nation and planet are connected by
technologies of {\it ad hoc} communication.  Communication succeeds or
fails by language, character, and education.

The field of awareness is found in and developed with technology and
education.

Our sustenance is found in awareness, and our annihilation is found in
ignorance.
