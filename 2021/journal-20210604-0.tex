{\section Metaphysical review}

\bigskip

In 2007 Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote an editorial for the Washington Post
entitled ``Terrorized by the War on Terror'' in which he described the
domestic product of the new terrorism [Sunday 2007/03/25 Washington Post]

\medskip
Since then, the psychological distortion effect of the echo chamber of
denial, disassembly, and evasion has perverted the global course of
human history.

\medskip
The exploitation of the stomachs of ``jobs'' and the minds of
``families'' to the criminal evasion of prosecution is grotesque in
its longevity and propagation.
