{\title Logical existentialism}

{\date Thursday, 17 June 2021}

{\section Metaphysical reference frame system}

\bigskip

The metaphysical frame ($\phi$), observable ($\omega$), object ($o$),
and association ($\rho$) are mathematical types.  [2021/06/15 1]
$$
 \phi \, [ \, \omega \rightarrow_{\rho} o \, ]
$$

The metaphysical concern is structured by their distinction.  The
logical concern is interested by their distinction, as well.  Their
primitiveness is extraordinary.

\medskip
\noindent The metaphysical assertion of primality is existential.
\smallskip
\noindent The logical assertion of primality is positivistic.
\medskip

The epistemological primality is found in positivism.  However, the
epistemological assertion is abstract.  It is related to veracity.
This physical primality is found in existentialism.

Siddharta is not displaced by Bertrand Russel, he is illuminated by
him.  Siddharta has existed.  And likewise, Socrates.

We might pretend that animals have no language, but we cannot pretend
that animals have neither actuality nor veracity.  The dog knows that
he scared the bird by barking.  He might know by intent, reflection,
or he might recognize that I told him so.
