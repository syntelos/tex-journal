{\section Physical society}

\bigskip

The global social reference frame
$$
 \sigma_{\phi} = \pi_{\phi} + \lambda_{\phi} + \gamma_{\phi} + \rho_{\phi} + \tau_{\phi}
$$
captures issues of society, economy, and government.  Time in frame
agrees with general relativity, and is physical.  Observables in frame
develop and evolve in time.

In Thursday's {\it Metaphysical review} [2021/06/03 Journal 0] the
issues of politics and economy connected political history with the
terms {\it capitalism} and {\it socialism} in terms of political power
over capital.

That observation was subsequently related to the metaphysical
reference system with {\it Physical socialism} [2021/06/03 Journal 1].
In the metaphysical reference system ($\sigma\phi\tau$), {\it physical
socialism} contrasts to {\it physical capitalism} as the national
power is sovereign or subjugated.

In {\it Political narcissism} [2021/06/03 Journal 2], the
concentration of power in the national political establishment is
introduced.  In result, the betrayal of the sovereignty of humanity by
political subjugation is found in cases foreign and domestic.

In today's {\it Metaphysical review} [2021/06/04 Journal 0], relating
President Biden's ``fingerprints''.
