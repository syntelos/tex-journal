{\section Imaginary power dynamics}

\body

There is a distinction to be made between the exploitation of
imaginary power and the occurance of imaginary power.  And then the
meaning of imaginary power as a term reprepresentative of an
exploitable resource.

It is the persistence of an intellectual resource that presents the
potential for exploitation.  And it is the power of an intellectual
potential over population that values that exploitation.

Let us recognize an imaginary power that is usurped, and an
intellectual power that is deserved.

In recent experience, an imaginary performance of sexual sadomasochism
was produced as an attempted performance of sexual self annihilation.
The power of sexual sadomasochism is elusive, but real, and the
material of imaginary power.  Sexuality has a unique center of
consciousness which occludes intellectual acuity by sexual
sublimation.  Some will be captured by that.
