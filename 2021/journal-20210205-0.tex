{\title Logical existentialism}

{\section A logical psychology of development}

\body

A cognitive process has a strategy or theme of effect.  It is
classified by one of self preservation or self destruction.

In awareness one maintains a conservation of self, other, and society.
By insecurity one is prey to the passions of cognitive processes
derived from objectification and rationalization in place of 
reflection.

A psychological phenomenology of narcissism, sadism, masochism, and
spremacism is a possible ontology of cognitive strategy (in illbeing).
Another is existentialism, subsistentialism, and nihsistantialism (as
wellbeing, crisis, and grave).
