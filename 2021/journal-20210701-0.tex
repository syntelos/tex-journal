{\section DHS + FBI}

\bigskip

The FBI twitter looks like a metaphysical terror of association and
timing. [2021/06/28 Journal 0] [2021/06/26 Journal 0]

That conclusion brings the death nell to DHS and FBI.  An exasperating
realization.  That the organs of government required by the executive
to operate against crime and terror are the origin of that crime and
terror.

It's plainly bizarre.  That I should offer the criminal accusation and
that it should be so willingly taken up.  Recalls the assertion that
they threaten the executive, directly.
