\input preamble

From ancient to modern times we herald the arrival of science and
journalism and art as the social peers of government. 

That government regulates economy and science reviews and develops
government's oversight of fairness and prosperity in economy is -- at
present -- a human social constant.  That is, perhaps some day
government and its politics will have greater freedom from the tedium
of practical economics.

Today that relationship remains stressful and occassionally combative.
The art of life will, eventually, develop across culture to minimize
stress and antagony.  To replace it with the recognition of work,
effort and value and merit.  This will occur when politically
substantial numbers of eyes are clear of their distrations from the
natural sight of value, and have grown to know merit.
