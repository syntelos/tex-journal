``The expectation of freedom is traded, in some quarters, for the
absence of expectation.  For the freedom to be null and void, inert,
inutile, meaningless, and pointless.''

``The positive expectation is traded for the negative expectation.''

``I'm not sure the negative expectation has a sign.  I think it's
vacuous.''

``It is darkness and poverty and the absence of \break merit, and in this
constructed sense it is inert and meaningless.''

``Yes.  Steven King's Langoliers.  The dimension that exists between
the cracks.  The poverty of education that exists in this world.''
