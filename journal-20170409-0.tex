\input preamble

Life, in her hands, felt fragile.  It rested on air, sat on a table,
or fell in a well according to a feeling, an intent.  

She looked at the rose that fell into an eye next to a knee.  She bent
down to place both onto it and found its scent filled her nose.  The
smell of the rose lifted it into the sunlight.  Beads of dew held
globes of refracted energy on red velvet surfaces.  A bird called out
and she turned.  The star at the center of this system filled the sky
with a blue color.  The planet had only just rotated into the light
from the star.  It would not be long before the atmospheric water that
decorated the rose would evaporate from the energy of its radiation.

She followed the sound of the bird into a tree.  It stood on a thin
branch at a height only a meter above her head.  Its red breast and
dark coat were familiar.  The type were occasionally seen in the grass
around the bush where she walked after breakfast.
